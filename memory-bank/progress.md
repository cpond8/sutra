# Sutra Engine - Progress

## NATIVE .SUTRA FILE LOADING STATUS (2025-07-07)

**ASSESSMENT COMPLETE:** Native `.sutra` file loading is **~85% functional** with one critical blocker.

### ‚úÖ WORKING: Core Infrastructure Complete

- **CLI Interface**: `./target/debug/sutra run file.sutra` works perfectly
- **Parser Pipeline**: parse ‚Üí macroexpand ‚Üí validate ‚Üí evaluate fully functional
- **Basic Scripts**: `(print "Hello, world!")` and built-in macros work flawlessly
- **Grammar**: Both s-expression and brace-block syntax supported
- **Error Handling**: Span preservation, structured errors, debugging support

### ‚ùå CRITICAL BLOCKER: User-Defined Macro Pipeline

**The Issue**: While macro definitions parse correctly, user-defined macros are not being expanded:

```lisp
(define (greet name) (print (+ "Hello, " name "!")))
(greet "Alice")  ;; Error: Unknown macro or atom: greet
```

**Root Cause**: Macro definition partitioning and/or expansion lookup is broken:
- Macro definitions appear in final expanded output (should be filtered)
- User macros not found during expansion phase
- Fixed critical parser bug but integration issues remain

**Impact**: Blocks all language extensibility and higher-level authoring patterns.

## Debug Infrastructure (2025-07-07)

**Created systematic debug files** in `debug/macro-testing/` during native file loading investigation:
- 7 test files covering basic functionality and macro definition scenarios
- Comprehensive README documenting findings and test methodology
- Fixed critical parser bug through systematic isolation testing
- Established reproducible test cases for macro system development

This debugging approach proved essential for separating parser issues (resolved) from integration issues (ongoing).

## PARSING PIPELINE STATUS (2025-07-07)

**ASSESSMENT COMPLETE:** The canonical parsing pipeline plan is **substantially implemented and working**.

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Core Architecture**: Modular pipeline (parse ‚Üí macroexpand ‚Üí validate ‚Üí evaluate)
- **Parser/AST Builder**: Full pest-based implementation with span-carrying nodes
- **Macroexpander**: Robust template system with recursion limits and parameter binding
- **Validator**: Extensible registry with diagnostic system and span-carrying errors
- **Integration**: Working pipeline with integration tests passing

### üîÑ REMAINING (Low Priority)
- Interface formalization (trait extraction)
- CST traversal APIs (iterator/visitor patterns)
- Advanced features (incremental parsing, auto-fix, advanced hygiene)

**CONCLUSION**: Pipeline architecture is sound and functional. Focus should remain on native .sutra file loading, NOT pipeline refactoring.

## Completed Major Work

### Foundation and Core Engine (Complete)
- **Project Scaffolding**: Structure, data types, unified PEG parser, atom engine
- **Core Engine**: Macro expansion, standard library, atom engine, test suite
- **Language Specification**: Fully synchronized with codebase implementation
- **Design Phase**: All architectural decisions, plans, and documentation complete

### Quality and Architecture Audits (Complete)
- **Macro Path Canonicalization**: Contract and canonicalization fully implemented
- **Registry Pattern**: Canonical builders and test/production parity enforced
- **Error Handling**: Structured, span-carrying errors with two-phase enrichment
- **AST/Parser**: Span-carrying nodes, unified PEG grammar, consistent error handling
- **CLI/Output**: Pure orchestrator, centralized output, test/production parity

### Recent Infrastructure (2025-07-07)
- **File Hierarchy**: Reorganized into modular directories (`src/syntax/`, `src/ast/`, etc.)
- **Integration Tests**: Created `tests/scripts/` for protocol-compliant `.sutra` tests
- **Debug Infrastructure**: Systematic macro testing in `debug/macro-testing/`

## Current Roadmap

### TOP PRIORITY: Native .sutra File Loading
1. **Debug macro definition pipeline** - investigate partitioning and registry construction
2. **Debug macro expansion** - verify user macros passed to expander and lookup works
3. **Integration testing** - ensure end-to-end macro definition and usage works

### Macro System Bootstrapping (Post-Blocker)
1. **Macro Migration**: Rewrite higher-level macros as native macros, remove Rust implementations
2. **Macro Hygiene**: Design and implement hygiene system (gensym for local bindings)
3. **Standard Library Expansion**: Implement narrative/gameplay macros as native macros
4. **Validation**: Structural and semantic validation before/after macro expansion
5. **Documentation**: Update all docs to reflect new macro system

## Test Suite Protocol

**All tests must be written as user-facing Sutra scripts (s-expr or braced), asserting only on observable output, world queries, or errors as surfaced to the user. No direct Rust API or internal data structure manipulation is permitted.**

**Current Test Organization:**
- Inline tests for small modules
- Rust integration/unit tests in `tests/rust/`
- Protocol-compliant integration tests in `tests/scripts/`

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

- **Test Suite Rewrite Required**: Full rewrite to protocol-compliant `.sutra` scripts needed
- **Performance Validation**: Not yet tested with large-scale content
- **User Macro System**: Editor integration and advanced tooling require careful design
- **Macro Hygiene**: Advanced hygiene beyond current scope management needed
