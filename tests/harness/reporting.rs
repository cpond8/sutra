//! # Miette-Powered Reporting and Diagnostics
//!
//! This module provides utilities for rendering test results, errors, and mismatches
//! using miette's rich diagnostics and pretty printers.
//!
//! ## Philosophy Alignment
//! - **Transparency:** All failures are surfaced with full context and actionable help.
//! - **Compositionality:** Reporting utilities are pure consumers of results and diagnostics.
//! - **Extensibility:** New result types and diagnostics are easy to add.

/// Render a test result or diagnostic using miette.
