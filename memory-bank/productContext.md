- Empower authors to build any narrative or simulation system
- Lower the barrier to experimentation
- Provide full transparency into authoring and debugging
- Enable robust, testable, and maintainable content

## User Experience Principles

- Compositionality, transparency, extensibility, minimalism, portability
