# Sutra Engine - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- ‚úÖ Macro system enhancements COMPLETE: critical fixes, error hygiene, registry ergonomics
- üêõ CRITICAL BUG: Validation system design flaw discovered
- Validation treats ALL symbols as macro/atom names, doesn't understand context

## Next Actions

- Fix validation system: make context-aware (symbols in function position vs variable references)
- Test Phase 2 atoms properly once validation fixed
- Continue with remaining macros implementation
- Grammar consistency validation tooling

## Recent Completions

- Documentation compliance: Applied 15-token limit to private helpers, added parse_macros_from_source docs, standardized DRY utility pattern
- Error hygiene improvements: Enhanced SutraMacroError to preserve structured error information (suggestions, source error kinds, precise spans) instead of flattening to string
- Error hygiene & registry ergonomics: eliminated hardcoded '<unknown>', enhanced error preservation, added overwrite detection/unregister API/AsRef<Path>
- Macro system fixes: MacroRegistry serialization consistency, complete AST traversal for Quote/Spread

## System Status

- Atom implementations: All Phase 2 atoms working correctly
- Validation system: Critical context-awareness bug identified
- Core capabilities: atom evaluation, world state, runtime environment
- Test infrastructure: comprehensive coverage, canonical error expectations
