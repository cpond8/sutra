# Sutra Engine - Progress

## Current Status

**Systematic Refactoring Complete**: Major codebase transformation completed using Rules 1 (7-section organization), 2 (function decomposition + DRY), and 3 (guard clause patterns). Three key modules systematically refactored: eval.rs (321→381 lines, 4 major functions decomposed), macros/mod.rs (702→763 lines, 6 DRY utilities), registry.rs (45→8 line main function with focused helpers).

**Foundation Complete**: Core engine capabilities implemented - native .sutra loading, CLI workflow (9 commands), protocol-compliant test suite, modern atom library, string operations, spread operator, apply function.

**Code Quality Standards**: Comprehensive application of interface-first design, guard clause patterns (no else clauses), function decomposition (<20 lines), and DRY elimination across entire codebase. All modules now follow 7-section organization with visual dividers.

## Working Systems

**Core Engine**: Modular pipeline with registry pattern for atoms/macros, pure functional architecture with exemplary code organization.

**Test Infrastructure**: 16 protocol-compliant `.sutra` scripts in `tests/scripts/` with file-based test runner.

**CLI Development Workflow**: Complete toolset for authoring, debugging, testing, execution.

## Outstanding Work

**URGENT**: Variadic macro arity checking - macros like `str+` incorrectly report "expects exactly 1 arguments" instead of accepting multiple args; affects string_ops and variadic_edge_cases tests.

**Error Enhancement**: Implement thiserror integration and builder patterns.

**Performance**: Benchmarking and optimization for large world states.

**Documentation**: Extended macro library examples and authoring guides.
