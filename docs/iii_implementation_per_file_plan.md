Here is a **carefully considered, refined, per-file breakdown** for the Sutra core, with type sketches and public API signatures. Every aspect has been revisited for clarity, modularity, and future-proofing. Design notes are included at each step.

_Last Updated: 2025-07-01_

---

# **1. src/ast.rs**

> **Principle:** Only represent syntax trees and spans; _no_ evaluation or macro logic.

```rust
// All AST nodes carry a span for source tracking; enables better errors and explainability.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct Span {
    pub start: usize,
    pub end: usize,
    // Optionally: line/col for richer error UX.
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Expr {
    List(Vec<Expr>, Span),
    Symbol(String, Span),
    String(String, Span),
    Number(f64, Span),
    Bool(bool, Span),
}

impl Expr {
    pub fn span(&self) -> Span { /* ... */ }
    // Utility: pretty printing, tree walking
    pub fn pretty(&self) -> String { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Notes:**

- By centralizing all source location handling here, error UX and tracing throughout the pipeline are improved.

- **No coupling to Value/World.**

---

# **2. src/value.rs**

> **Principle:** Only runtime data values; _never_ AST. Pure data.

```rust
use im::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Value {
    Number(f64),
    String(String),
    Bool(bool),
    List(Vec<Value>),
    Map(HashMap<String, Value>),
    // Optional: Nil, for missing/void, if desired
}

impl Value {
    pub fn type_name(&self) -> &'static str;
    pub fn as_number(&self) -> Option<f64>;
    pub fn as_bool(&self) -> Option<bool>;
    // ...etc.
}
```

**Notes:**

- Explicit conversion and type guard methods prevent accidental type confusion.

- Only for runtime state, _never_ for code.

---

# **3. src/world.rs**

> **Principle:** Pure, persistent, deeply immutable world state.

```rust
use crate::value::Value;
use im::HashMap;
use rand::{RngCore, SeedableRng};

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct World {
    data: Value,           // Root of persistent tree (usually a Map)
    prng: SmallRng,        // Deterministic PRNG for reproducibility
}

impl World {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn get(&self, path: &[&str]) -> Option<&Value>;
    pub fn set(&self, path: &[&str], val: Value) -> Self;
    pub fn del(&self, path: &[&str]) -> Self;
    // PRNG access for deterministic randomness
    pub fn next_u32(&mut self) -> u32;
    // Serialization for snapshotting/debug
    pub fn to_json(&self) -> serde_json::Value;
}
```

**Notes:**

- Paths are slice-based (`&[&str]`) for type-safety and ergonomics (vs raw strings).

- PRNG lives _inside_ world, guaranteeing deterministic "randomness".

- World never exposes mutation—every op returns a new World.

---

# **4. src/error.rs**

> **Principle:** Unified error reporting, spans, and explainability everywhere.

```rust
use crate::ast::Span;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct EvalError {
    pub message: String,
    pub expanded_code: String,
    pub original_code: Option<String>,
    pub suggestion: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum SutraErrorKind {
    Parse(String),
    Macro(String),
    Validation(String),
    Eval(EvalError),
    Io(String),
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct SutraError {
    pub kind: SutraErrorKind,
    pub span: Option<Span>,
}

impl SutraError {
    // Enriches the error with original source code context.
    pub fn with_source(mut self, source: &str) -> Self;
}

impl std::fmt::Display for SutraError { /* ... */ }
impl std::error::Error for SutraError { /* ... */ }
```

**Notes:**

- Uniform error type for the entire pipeline.

- Span is always available for user feedback/debug.

---

# **5. src/parser.rs**

> **Principle:** Stateless, pure, unified, and formally defined via PEG.

```rust
use crate::ast::{Expr, Span};
use crate::error::SutraError;

// The unified parser for all Sutra syntaxes.
// It will intelligently dispatch to the correct top-level
// grammar rule (s-expression or brace-block) based on input.
pub fn parse(source: &str) -> Result<Expr, SutraError>;
```

**Notes:**

- This module is a thin wrapper around a `pest`-based parser.
- The formal grammar is defined in `src/sutra.pest`.
- Contains a private `ast_mapper` submodule to handle the transformation from `pest`'s CST to our canonical `Expr` AST. This mapping logic is rigorously unit-tested.
- Pure function; never mutates or performs semantic validation.
- Testable in isolation with golden files for both syntaxes.

---

# **6. src/atom.rs**

> **Principle:** Minimal, compositional, no magic or macro logic.

```rust
use crate::ast::Expr;
use crate::eval::EvalContext;
use crate::value::Value;
use crate::world::World;
use crate::error::SutraError;

// Atom function type: takes AST arguments, the current evaluation context,
// and the span of the parent expression for high-quality error reporting.
pub type AtomFn = fn(
    args: &[Expr],
    context: &mut EvalContext,
    parent_span: &Span,
) -> Result<(Value, World), SutraError>;

// Output sink for `print`, etc.
pub trait OutputSink {
    fn emit(&mut self, text: &str, span: Option<&Span>);
}

// Registry for all atoms, inspectable at runtime.
pub struct AtomRegistry {
    pub atoms: HashMap<String, AtomFn>,
}

impl AtomRegistry {
    pub fn get(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&AtomFn>;
    pub fn list(&self) -> Vec<String>;
    // Registration API for extensibility
    pub fn register(&mut self, name: &str, func: AtomFn);
}
```

**Notes:**

- All atoms take input AST and World, always return Value or error, _never_ hidden side-effects.

- Output is handled through explicit trait, enabling test mocks.

---

# **7. src/eval.rs**

> **Principle:** Pure interpreter, TCO, stateless except for output and world transition.

**Notes:**

- The evaluator's role is strictly to execute atoms. It does not perform any kind of implicit symbol resolution.
- Bare symbols are treated as a semantic error, ensuring that all world lookups are made explicit via `(get ...)` by the macro system.

```rust
use crate::ast::Expr;
use crate::world::World;
use crate::atom::{AtomRegistry, OutputSink};
use crate::error::SutraError;

pub struct EvalOptions {
    pub max_depth: usize,
    pub atom_registry: AtomRegistry,
}

// The context for a single evaluation, passed to atoms.
pub struct EvalContext<'a, 'o> {
    pub world: &'a World,
    pub output: &'o mut dyn OutputSink,
    pub opts: &'a EvalOptions,
    pub depth: usize,
}

impl<'a, 'o> EvalContext<'a, 'o> {
    // Helper for atoms to evaluate their arguments.
    pub fn eval(&mut self, expr: &Expr) -> Result<(Value, World), SutraError>;
}

pub fn eval(
    expr: &Expr,
    world: &World,
    output: &mut dyn OutputSink,
    opts: &EvalOptions,
) -> Result<(Value, World), SutraError>;
```

**Notes:**

- Evaluator only depends on atom registry, input AST, and output sink.

- Depth is capped for recursion guard (configurable).

- Eval returns new world and value, never mutates input.

---

# **8. src/macros.rs** (renamed from `macro.rs`)

> **Principle:** Syntactic, stateless, author-inspectable, fully testable.

**Notes:**

- This module is responsible for the "auto-get" feature and for providing detailed expansion tracing for debugging.
- **All macro-generated atom path arguments are now strictly canonicalized at expansion time, using a single helper (`canonicalize_path`).**
- Macroexpansion is a pure, `AST -> AST` transformation and has no access to the `World`.

```rust
use crate::ast::Expr;
use crate::error::SutraError;

// Represents a single step in the macro expansion trace.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct TraceStep {
    pub description: String,
    pub ast: Expr,
}

pub type MacroFn = fn(&Expr) -> Result<Expr, SutraError>;

// The main entry point for the macro expansion pipeline stage.
pub fn expand(expr: &Expr) -> Result<Expr, SutraError>;

// Macro registry for both built-in and user macros
pub struct MacroRegistry {
    pub macros: HashMap<String, MacroFn>,
}

impl MacroRegistry {
    pub fn expand_recursive(&self, expr: &Expr, depth: usize) -> Result<Expr, SutraError>;
    pub fn register(&mut self, name: &str, func: MacroFn);
    // Returns a full, step-by-step trace of the expansion process.
    pub fn macroexpand_trace(&self, expr: &Expr) -> Result<Vec<TraceStep>, SutraError>;
}
```

# **9. src/macros_std.rs**

> **Principle:** All narrative/gameplay constructs live here as macros, never as atoms or engine hacks.

```rust
use crate::ast::Expr;
use crate::error::SutraError;

// Each standard macro is an exported function with this signature.
// Example:
pub fn expand_is(expr: &Expr) -> Result<Expr, SutraError>;
pub fn expand_add(expr: &Expr) -> Result<Expr, SutraError>;
// ... and so on for all standard macros.
```

**Notes:**

- All Tier 1–3 narrative/gameplay macros are defined here, in Rust, but _in terms of macro expansion_ (not eval).
- **All assignment/path macros now strictly enforce canonicalization of path arguments at expansion time, using the single canonicalization helper.**
- Each macro has a docstring, usage, and macroexpansion test.

---

# **(NEW) 9a. src/atoms_std.rs**

> **Principle:** Atom contracts now strictly require canonical path arguments.

**Notes:**

- All atoms that operate on world paths (e.g., `set!`, `get`, `del!`) now require the canonical flat `(list ...)` form for path arguments, as enforced by macro expansion and tested throughout the suite.
- Any non-canonical path form is rejected with a clear error.

---

# **10. src/validate.rs**

> **Principle:** Structural and semantic passes are separate; all validation is functional and batch.

```rust
use crate::ast::Expr;
use crate::error::SutraError;

pub fn validate_structure(expr: &Expr) -> Vec<SutraError>;
pub fn validate_semantics(expr: &Expr) -> Vec<SutraError>;
```

**Notes:**

- Returns _all_ errors, not just first.

- Can be used before/after macroexpansion.

---

# **11. src/brace_translator.rs (REMOVED)**

> This module has been removed. Its functionality is now part of the unified PEG parser in `src/parser.rs`.

---

# **12. src/cli/**

> **Principle:** A pure orchestrator of the core library, with a focus on user experience.

### **`src/cli/mod.rs`**

- Contains the main `run()` function for the CLI.
- Responsible for parsing arguments and dispatching to subcommand handlers.

### **`src/cli/args.rs`**

- Defines all CLI arguments, subcommands, and help messages using `clap`.
- `pub struct SutraArgs` is the top-level container.
- `pub enum Command` defines all subcommands (`Run`, `Macrotrace`, etc.).

### **`src/cli/output.rs`**

- Handles all printing to the console.
- Contains functions like `print_trace` which use `termcolor` and `difference` to create rich, readable output.
- Centralizes error formatting logic.

**Notes:**

- CLI is fully testable, can be used in CI.

- CLI uses output sinks for print, macroexpand trace, etc.

---

# **13. /tests, /examples, /docs**

- **Golden test files for parser, macro, atom, world, CLI.**

- **Example scripts for all author-facing macro patterns.**

- **Markdown docs for engine pipeline, extending macros/atoms, etc.**

---

# **Design Review and Iteration Log**

**Decisions double-checked:**

- **All logic is stateless, except world (which is persistently immutable).**

- **No module depends on “upstream” logic.**

- **Span-tracking enables best-possible error UX.**

- **Output and randomness are both always explicit, never hidden.**

- **Macro and atom registries allow for open-ended extension and in-CLI inspection.**

- **All pipelines are explicit, testable, and stepwise: translate/parse → macroexpand → validate → eval → output.**

- **Golden tests and documentation are never an afterthought—they are essential.**

---

**This plan represents a carefully iterated, principle-driven, robust foundation for Sutra.**

---

Here is a **careful, high-level system review**—evaluating not just the parts, but their emergent sum. The following is not a rote checklist, but a deep “zoom out” analysis for architectural wholeness, long-term maintainability, and fitness for your project philosophy.

---

## **Holistic System Review**

### **1. Modular Cohesion and Decoupling**

**Strengths:**

- Each component is independently testable, reusable, and replaceable.

- The “single source of truth” principle is maintained: all state flows through `World`; all code through canonical AST.

- Output, randomness, and error reporting are always explicit and never global/singleton.

- Macro and atom registries create clear boundaries—adding new language features never pollutes existing code.

**Potential Risk:**

- If macro/atom registration were ever to become dynamic or support user loading, concurrency and versioning might need to be managed.
  **Mitigation:**

- For now, registries are simple, and can be made thread-safe or hot-swappable in the future as a pure wrapper.

---

### **2. Purity, Immutability, and Determinism**

**Strengths:**

- All world changes are persistent; no mutation, no global state, no OOP side effects.

- PRNG inside `World` ensures all randomness is reproducible and serializable.

- No step in the pipeline can “cheat” and affect anything except by explicit data flow.

**Potential Risk:**

- Deep world state cloning could be a perf issue for very large worlds (but in practice, `im` structures are efficient for most real usage).
  **Mitigation:**

- If you hit scaling limits, swap in a faster persistent structure later; API contract does not change.

---

### **3. Error Handling and Explainability**

**Strengths:**

- All errors are tagged with spans, pipeline step, and context.

- Macroexpansion, validation, and eval errors are distinguishable and explainable to users/authors.

- CLI/test harness exposes pipeline step by step for debugging.

**Potential Flaw:**

- If an error occurs after spans are dropped (eg, late in eval), you could lose some precision in reporting.
  **Mitigation:**

- Always preserve span as far down the pipeline as possible, or “bubble up” context from last known node.

---

### **4. Extensibility and Evolution**

**Strengths:**

- Atoms and macros are not “hardcoded” into the engine; they’re registered in data structures, enabling future plugins/extensions.

- Author-facing language (storylet, pools, etc.) is all macros, never privileged engine code.

- CLI/test harness can script, inspect, and test every pipeline step.

**Potential Oversight:**

- User macros (for runtime authoring) are not in MVP, but pipeline is ready for them.
  **Mitigation:**

- Design registry and macro expansion to eventually support user-defined macros and module imports, without architectural rewrite.

---

### **5. Testing, Documentation, and Golden Files**

**Strengths:**

- All golden file and property-based testing is first-class, not an afterthought.

- Docstrings, usage examples, and canonical patterns are included with every macro and atom.

- System is library-first, CLI second—always automatable, never brittle.

---

### **6. Cross-Cutting Principle Audit**

| Principle                   | Upheld? | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single Source of Truth      | ✓       | World for state; AST for code.                               |
| Minimalism                  | ✓       | Atoms are minimal; macros compose all else.                  |
| Separation of Concerns      | ✓       | Parser, macro, eval, validate, world, CLI all isolated.      |
| Pure Functions/Immutability | ✓       | All logic is pure or persistent.                             |
| Modularity/Composability    | ✓       | Registry pattern everywhere; code is “plug-and-play.”        |
| Transparency/Traceability   | ✓       | Spans, macroexpansion trace, output sinks, explain features. |
| Determinism                 | ✓       | PRNG in world, no global state.                              |
| Extensibility               | ✓       | Macro/atom/user macro registries are open.                   |

---

## **Can it be improved?**

**Are there "last mile" refinements left?**

### _Possibilities:_

- **Path Typing:**
  Consider a newtype for world paths (not just `&[&str]` but a `Path` struct), for better ergonomics and type safety.

- **Span Carryover:**
  Always preserve span on Value and World for better error reporting deep in the stack.

- **Test Hooks Everywhere:**
  Ensure every sink (output, macroexpansion, world snapshot) is easily injectable for fuzz/property tests.

- **Registry Introspection:**
  CLI and API should always allow querying the registry for macros/atoms available and their docstrings.

- **Macro Hygiene:**
  For user macros (future), hygiene needs deeper design—possibly explore pattern-matching libraries like egg (Rust) for macro system, but this can wait.

---

**But:**

None of these are foundational flaws—**they are incremental refinements, not architectural shifts**.
The overall design achieves the stated project goals, aligns fully with your principles, and has no hidden tight couplings, ambiguities, or risks of “tech debt” growth if faithfully maintained.

---

## **Conclusion**

**This is a robust, principle-aligned, extensible foundation for Sutra.**

- If you build exactly as above, you will have an engine that is easy to maintain, refactor, and extend, and that will never “paint you into a corner.”

- All future features (editor, user macros, simulation) can grow organically, with no architectural regrets.

---

Here is a **comprehensive review** of your implementation plan against the full set of project files, focusing on alignment with philosophy, architectural fit, and any hidden structural flaws or implementation risks.

---

# 1. **High-Level Architectural Alignment**

Your staged implementation plan, file/module plan, and per-file breakdown are **deeply aligned** with the documented philosophy and architecture of the Sutra Engine:

- **Strict layering:** Parsing, macro-expansion, validation, evaluation, and output are cleanly decoupled and pure; only world state is allowed to be "mutable" (but done immutably).

- **Single source of truth:** All state flows through the `World` object; no hidden globals or engine magic.

- **All author-facing constructs (storylets, pools, etc.) are macros** and not engine-privileged; the macro system is strictly syntactic and never touches world state.

- **Testing, validation, and introspection** are first-class, not afterthoughts; every stage is testable in isolation, and error reporting is required to carry spans for maximal author/developer usability.

---

# 2. **Detailed Structural Review**

### **A. Staged Implementation Outline**

- **Stage 0 (Philosophy/CI/Scaffolding):**
  Properly prioritizes foundation (README, guiding principles) and TDD.
  **Suggestion:** Explicitly add a README section on the difference between the _canonical AST_ and authoring syntax, with visual diagrams. This will anchor future contributors and clarify the brace-block vs s-expr approach.

- **Stage 1 (AST/Data Types):**
  Correct separation between AST (syntax tree), Value (runtime data), and World (state).
  **Potential Pitfall:**

  - Ensure _all_ world mutation helpers in `world.rs` are pure (returning new World).

  - Document how "path" navigation works (avoid stringly-typed access—consider a `Path` struct or at least enforce slice-of-str for safety).

- **Stage 2 (Parser):**
  Parser is pure, stateless, does not perform semantic checks—excellent.
  **Risk:**

  - AST nodes must _always_ retain source span/location, or at least allow attaching debug info post-factum; this is crucial for macro expansion/explain tools.

- **Stage 3 (Atom Engine):**
  All atoms are pure functions `(AST, World) -> (Value, World)`; output is handled by injectable callback.
  **Positive:**

  - This is exactly what the philosophy and architecture require.

- **Stage 4 (Macro System):**
  Macros are pure AST-in/AST-out transforms; macro hygiene and expansion depth are called out.
  **Risk:**

  - If user macros are added later, careful namespace management will be needed; plan for that in the registry now, even if deferred.

- **Stage 5 (Validation):**
  Two-pass: structure (pre-macro) and semantics (post-macro).
  **Strength:**

  - This separation prevents many authoring bugs.
    **Enhancement:**

  - Optionally, add a "linter" pass for warnings (not just errors)—this can catch common authoring anti-patterns or risky choices.

- **Stage 6 (CLI/Test Harness):**
  CLI is always layered _above_ the library, never calling internals directly.
  **Strength:**

  - Prevents "leaky abstraction" and ensures testability/automation.

- **Stage 7 (History, Pools, Selection):**
  Macro layer only—selection, weighting, and history are not engine privileges.
  **Positive:**

  - Matches Emily Short's design patterns and all macro/pool specs.

- **Stage 8 (Documentation/Examples):**
  Example-driven documentation and golden tests are prioritized.
  **Best Practice:**

  - Keeps the engine honest and future-proof.

- **Stage 9 (Brace-Block DSL Translator):**
  Fully decoupled, pure; can be inserted or omitted with no impact to pipeline.

- **Stage 10 (Iteration/Refinement):**
  All future extensions are added as new macros, atoms, or test files—_never_ by patching core code or creating special cases.

---

### **B. Module/File Plan and Per-File Details**

- Every module does exactly one job; no cross-layer coupling.

- **Atom, macro, and registry pattern** enables CLI, tests, and downstream consumers to always introspect what atoms/macros exist (critical for maintainability and UX).

- **Span and error handling:** Consistently propagated through every stage.

- **World state**: Always persistent/immutable; all helpers return new world.

**Potential incremental improvements:**

- **Path abstraction:** Consider introducing a `Path` struct/type (vs. raw `&[&str]`) for extra type-safety, especially as world trees get deep or authors start composing paths dynamically.

- **Span Handling:**
  Ensure that error spans are preserved as far down the stack as possible, even into late evaluation or world diffing. Consider attaching last-known span to World or Value, at least in debug mode.

---

# 3. **Alignment with Authoring Patterns, Macro Library, and Narrative Design**

Your plan matches the documented **storylet/QBN architecture**, macro patterns, and all authoring surface guidelines:

- **All author-facing patterns are built as macros** (storylet, pool, select, sample, cycle, salience, resource gating, etc.).

- **Prefix notation is strictly enforced** at every level; no infix, no exceptions. The author-facing brace-block and s-expr syntaxes are one-to-one, and the canonical AST is always the central data structure.

- **Choices, delayed branching, hubs/spokes, salience, and cycles** are all supported through macro patterns, not privileged engine logic.

- **Pools and history are built as compositional, author-extensible macros**—no "magic" built into the engine, only the macro layer.

**Risks avoided:**

- No "object" systems or privileged game structures are creeping into the core; everything is just data + macros.

- Engine is not hardwired to any single narrative pattern (storylet, thread, pool, etc.); all are composable from the macro/atom set.

---

# 4. **Philosophy and Design Principle Audit**

The implementation plan is **fully aligned** with all core principles:

- **Minimal irreducible atom set**—no bloat, no redundancy.

- **All higher-level constructs are macros**; only atoms are implemented at the engine layer.

- **Pure functions, explicit state, no hidden side effects, no global state.**

- **Separation of concerns and single source of truth** at every architectural layer.

- **Extensibility:** New patterns, constructs, or features are always introduced via new macro libraries or, rarely, via well-justified new atoms. Never by changing the core engine in a breaking way.

---

# 5. **Risks, Possible Oversights, and Recommendations**

Most critiques in your _own_ review sections have already anticipated common risks—no major hidden flaws are visible. But here are a few possible **incremental improvements or subtle risks** to keep on radar:

### **A. Path Ergonomics and Safety**

- Current API uses `&[&str]` for path access in the world; consider a dedicated `Path` struct (with builder, validation, and display methods) to reduce bugs as the state tree grows.

### **B. Span Handling**

- Ensure that error spans are preserved as far down the stack as possible, even into late evaluation or world diffing. Consider attaching last-known span to World or Value, at least in debug mode.

### **C. Registry Management**

- As you add user macros, namespace management becomes crucial. Even though not an MVP concern, consider architecting registry types for potential scoping/modules from the start.

### **D. Test/Mock Infrastructure**

- All output (print, choice display, macro expansion traces) should be injectable (trait-based) for unit tests, property tests, and future UI integration.

### **E. Macro Hygiene and User-Defined Macros**

- The macro system is well-designed for author-facing use; however, user macros bring up hygiene/naming issues. A forward-looking registry design (with module/namespace) will make adding this in the future much easier.

### **F. CLI as Reference Tool**

- Consider making the CLI able to dump registry (macros, atoms), macroexpansion traces, and validation info in both brace and s-expr syntax, for debugging and author feedback.

### **G. Future UI/Editor Integration**

- Pipeline is designed to allow future editors, debuggers, or web UIs to slot in easily. Continue to test that all pipeline stages are accessible and introspectable via simple API calls, not just via CLI.

### **H. Performance (World Cloning/Immutability)**

- While persistent structures are fast for small/medium games, keep an eye on performance for very large worlds (tens of thousands of objects). Document (in README and code comments) the expected tradeoffs and the fact that the world API is swappable if scaling issues arise.

---

# 6. **Conclusion: Readiness and Robustness**

- **Your implementation plan is exemplary:** It is both a reflection and an embodiment of all Sutra principles and design goals. All major risks are either already addressed or documented as "to watch."

- **No critical flaws or hidden tight couplings found**. What minor potential issues exist (path abstraction, macro hygiene, future registry design) are incremental and do not require any foundational rework.

- **Your documentation, pipeline design, and authoring guidelines are all aligned with best practices** from both a software architecture and narrative design perspective.

**Final Assessment:**
**No major flaws. No blocking structural oversights. Your plan is a model implementation pipeline for a modern, compositional, minimal, macro-driven narrative/game engine.** Proceed as planned, with only minor continuous improvements as you go.
