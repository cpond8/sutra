# Sutra Engine - Progress

## Current Status

**Error Enhancement**: 4-phase implementation plan created. Ready to begin Phase 1 (thiserror integration).

**Foundation Complete**: Core engine capabilities implemented - native .sutra loading, CLI workflow (9 commands), protocol-compliant test suite, modern atom library, string operations, spread operator, apply function.

**Guard Clause Refactor**: Widespread application of let-else/early return idioms across atoms, test atoms, and CLI/output modules. Reduced nesting, improved clarity, and enforced modular decomposition.

**Atom/Test Atom Decomposition**: Large atoms (e.g., ATOM_APPLY) and test atoms refactored into focused helpers for maintainability and testability.

**CLI/Output Modularization**: CLI and output logic reorganized by function group, with helpers extracted for DRY and clarity.

## Working Systems

**Core Engine**: Modular pipeline with registry pattern for atoms/macros, pure functional architecture.

**Test Infrastructure**: 16 protocol-compliant `.sutra` scripts in `tests/scripts/` with file-based test runner.

**CLI Development Workflow**: Complete toolset for authoring, debugging, testing, execution.

## Outstanding Work

**Error Enhancement**: Implement thiserror integration and builder patterns.

**Performance**: Benchmarking and optimization for large world states.

**Documentation**: Extended macro library examples and authoring guides.
