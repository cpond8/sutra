## What's Left to Build

### Stage 1: Core Data Types (Not Started)
**Immediate Next Steps:**

- `Expr` enum for AST representation with span tracking
- `Value` enum for runtime data (Number, String, Bool, List, Map)
- `World` struct with persistent immutable state
- `SutraError` type with comprehensive error reporting
- Basic serialization and debug formatting

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** None
**Risk:** Low - well-specified, straightforward implementation

### Stage 2: S-Expression Parser (Not Started)
**Requirements:**

- Pure, stateless recursive descent parser
- Robust error reporting with source spans
- Support for symbols, strings, numbers, booleans, lists
- Comprehensive test suite with edge cases

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stage 1 (AST types)
**Risk:** Low - standard parsing problem with clear specification

### Stage 3: Atom Engine (Not Started)
**Core Implementation:**

- Registry pattern for atom dispatch
- All Tier 1 atoms: state mutations, math, predicates, control flow
- Tail-call optimized evaluator
- Output injection for testability
- Comprehensive atom test suite

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-2
**Risk:** Medium - TCO implementation and registry design need care

### Stage 4: Macro System (Not Started)
**Major Components:**

- Pattern-matching macro expansion
- Hygiene system for variable scoping
- Standard macro library (storylet, choice, pool, etc.)
- Expansion tracing for debugging
- Recursion depth limiting

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-3
**Risk:** Medium-High - macro hygiene and expansion can be complex

### Stage 5: Validation System (Not Started)
**Two-Pass Validation:**

- Structural validation (pre-expansion)
- Semantic validation (post-expansion)
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Author-friendly error messages

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-4
**Risk:** Low - validation rules are well-specified

### Stage 6: CLI and Testing Infrastructure (Not Started)
**Command-Line Interface:**

- Script execution with various output formats
- Macro expansion tracing and debugging
- World state inspection and snapshotting
- Integration with all pipeline stages

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-5
**Risk:** Low - thin wrapper over library API

### Stage 7: Standard Macro Library (Not Started)
**Narrative/Gameplay Macros:**

- All Tier 2-3 macros: pools, history, selection, grammar
- Comprehensive example scripts and usage patterns
- Performance testing with realistic content
- Documentation and tutorials

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-6
**Risk:** Medium - requires balancing power and simplicity

### Stage 8: Brace-Block Translator (Not Started)
**Alternative Syntax Support:**

- Line-oriented parser for brace-block syntax
- Lossless conversion to canonical s-expressions
- Round-trip testing and validation
- Integration with CLI and tooling

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stage 2 (parser foundation)
**Risk:** Low - well-specified translation rules

## Current Status Assessment

### Strengths
- **Exceptionally thorough design phase** - all major architectural decisions resolved
- **Clear implementation path** - each stage builds cleanly on previous work
- **Comprehensive documentation** - principles, specifications, and examples all complete
- **Risk mitigation** - potential issues identified and addressed in planning

### Potential Challenges
- **Macro system complexity** - hygiene and expansion can be tricky to get right
- **Performance optimization** - may need tuning for large worlds
- **User experience** - need real-world testing with content creators
- **Documentation maintenance** - keeping specs aligned with implementation

### Timeline Estimates
**Total Implementation Time:** 15-20 weeks for complete system

- **MVP (Stages 1-5):** 8-12 weeks
- **Complete Core (Stages 1-7):** 12-16 weeks
- **Full System (Stages 1-8):** 15-20 weeks

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### Current Issues
- No implementation yet - purely design phase
- Some design decisions may need revision during implementation
- Performance characteristics not yet validated

### Future Technical Debt Risks
- **Macro system feature creep** - need to resist adding too many convenience macros
- **Performance optimization pressure** - may conflict with purity/simplicity goals
- **User macro system** - will require careful namespace and security design
- **Editor integration** - may need API extensions for rich editing features

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Original Concept (Early Design)
- Started with minimalist Lisp-like language
- Focus on narrative scripting and interactive fiction

### Refined Architecture (Current)
- Expanded to support any game/simulation system
- Dual syntax for broader accessibility
- Emphasis on macro composition and extensibility
- Strong focus on debugging and author experience

### Validated Decisions
- **Atoms vs. macros split** - proven through exhaustive pattern mapping
- **Immutable world state** - simplifies debugging and testing significantly
- **Pipeline separation** - enables modular testing and tool development
- **Registry pattern** - provides clean extension points

### Open Research Questions
- **Optimal macro hygiene approach** - balance simplicity vs. power
- **Performance optimization strategies** - when and how to optimize
- **User macro system design** - security and namespace management
- **Advanced tooling requirements** - editor support, visual debugging
