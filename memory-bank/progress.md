# Project Progress

## Current Status: Stabilizing Core Systems

### Completed Major Milestones
- ✅ **Error System Refactoring (July 10)**: Comprehensive 633-line error.rs refactoring completed following project coding standards. Decomposed oversized functions, eliminated DRY violations, implemented data-driven suggestion system, reorganized into 7-section structure, unified type handling, and fixed documentation standards. All tests passing.
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Rich contextual error messages with suggestions, debugging context, and structured data-driven approach
- ✅ **Macro System**: Template macros, core macro infrastructure, parameter binding
- ✅ **Core Parsing**: AST building, validation, CST-to-AST conversion
- ✅ **Atom System**: Comprehensive atom evaluation with enhanced error reporting
- ✅ **Value System**: Complete type system implementation
- ✅ **Runtime Environment**: World state management, evaluation context

### Currently Working On
