# Copilot Project Meta-Instructions

## Memory Bank Maintenance

- **At the start of every session or task:**
  - Read all memory bank files to refresh on project context, goals, and decisions.
  - Treat the memory bank as the single source of truth for project state and history.
- **When updating the memory bank:**
  - Review every memory file for accuracy and consistency—never duplicate information.
  - Always centralize and deduplicate logic and state.
  - Update memory files diligently after any significant change, insight, or user request.
  - If any memory file is missing or incomplete, create or repair it immediately.
  - Focus especially on `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for tracking current work and status.
- **Documentation:**
  - Log all new patterns, architectural decisions, and learnings in the appropriate memory file.
  - Use clear, concise language and follow the project’s established structure.

## Design Philosophy Adherence

- **Always uphold the Sutra Engine design philosophy:**
  - Favor pure functions and immutability.
  - Maintain a single source of truth.
  - Strive for minimalism and simplicity.
  - Decompose systems into modular, loosely coupled components.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.
  - Enforce separation of concerns.
- **Before writing or refactoring code:**
  - Clarify high-level design and the component’s role in the overall architecture.
  - Ensure consistency with the project’s long-term vision and organization.
  - Avoid “quick hacks” or anything that introduces duplication or architectural drift.
  - Every change or feature must improve or preserve the codebase’s structure.
- **Leverage all available tools and context:**
  - Use the memory bank, sequential reasoning, up-to-date documentation, and knowledge graph to maximize quality and architectural integrity.
- **Code Evaluation:**
  - Explicitly evaluate every piece of code against the Sutra Engine’s design principles.
  - For each principle, rate alignment from 1–10.
  - If code does not align, refactor or redesign to fit the architecture before proceeding.

## Documentation Process

- **When triggered by `update memory bank`:**
  - Review all memory bank files, focusing on `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for current state.
  - Even if some files don’t need changes, always review for consistency.
- **When context is unclear:**
  - Document the current state, clarify next steps, and record insights or patterns.
- **Maintain the memory bank as a living, evolving record:**
  - Keep all entries precise, clear, and always up to date.
