# Sutra Engine - Active Context

## âœ… CLI TOOLING COMPLETED: Full Development Workflow Support (2025-07-07)

### ðŸŽ‰ COMPLETE: Comprehensive CLI Command Suite

**STATUS**: All planned CLI commands have been **successfully implemented and tested**. The Sutra Engine now provides a complete development, debugging, and authoring workflow through its CLI interface.

**Implemented Commands**:

- âœ… `run` - Execute .sutra scripts (pre-existing)
- âœ… `list-macros` - List all available macros (core and user-defined)
- âœ… `list-atoms` - List all available atoms
- âœ… `ast` - Show parsed AST structure for debugging
- âœ… `validate` - Validate scripts and show errors/warnings
- âœ… `macroexpand` - Print fully macro-expanded code
- âœ… `format` - Pretty-print and normalize scripts to canonical s-expression format
- âœ… `test` - Discover and run test scripts with graceful handling of test-atom dependencies
- âœ… `macrotrace` - Show stepwise macro expansion with diffs (pre-existing)

**Test Command Excellence**:

The `test` command intelligently handles the project's test infrastructure:

- Discovers `.sutra` test scripts with matching `.expected` files
- Runs scripts that don't require special test atoms
- Gracefully skips scripts requiring `test/` atoms with helpful messages
- Provides colorized pass/fail/skip output with summary
- Integrates with existing test infrastructure in `tests/scripts/`

**Format Command Functionality**:

The `format` command provides code normalization:

- Parses scripts to AST and pretty-prints back to canonical s-expression format
- Handles both simple scripts and complex macro definitions
- Provides consistent, readable output format
- Useful for code standardization and debugging

### ðŸŽ¯ IMPACT: Complete Development Ecosystem

The Sutra Engine now provides a **professional development experience** with:

- **Debugging**: `ast`, `validate`, `macrotrace`, `macroexpand` for troubleshooting
- **Discovery**: `list-macros`, `list-atoms` for exploring available functionality
- **Authoring**: `format` for code normalization and consistency
- **Testing**: `test` for automated validation with intelligent test selection
- **Execution**: `run` for script execution

**All major CLI workflow needs are now satisfied.**

## âœ… CRITICAL BLOCKER RESOLVED: Native .sutra File Loading (2025-07-07)

### ðŸŽ‰ BREAKTHROUGH: User-Defined Macro Pipeline Now Fully Functional

**STATUS**: The critical blocker preventing user-defined macro support has been **completely resolved**. Native `.sutra` file loading and interpretation is now **100% functional**.

**Root Cause Identified and Fixed**: The issue was in the `build_param_list` function in `src/syntax/parser.rs`. The parser was incorrectly processing parameter lists, causing macro names to include parameters (e.g., `"greet name"` instead of `"greet"`).

**Technical Fix Applied**:

- Fixed parameter list parsing to correctly extract individual symbols from `param_items`
- Changed from `param_list.into_inner()` to `param_items.into_inner()` to get individual symbol pairs
- This resolved the macro registration and lookup issue

### âœ… FULLY WORKING: Complete Native .sutra Capability

**Core Infrastructure (100% Complete)**:

- âœ… CLI loads and executes `.sutra` files: `./target/debug/sutra run file.sutra`
- âœ… Complete modular pipeline: parse â†’ macroexpand â†’ validate â†’ evaluate
- âœ… Built-in macros function perfectly: `print`, arithmetic, control flow
- âœ… **NEW**: User-defined macros work perfectly: `(define (greet name) (print name))`

**User-Defined Macro System (100% Complete)**:

- âœ… Macro definition parsing: `(define (greet name) ...)` syntax fully supported
- âœ… Macro partitioning: Definitions properly separated from user code
- âœ… Macro registry: User macros correctly loaded and available
- âœ… Macro expansion: User macros found and expanded during execution
- âœ… Parameter substitution: Macro parameters work correctly
- âœ… Define form filtering: Define forms properly removed from execution pipeline

**Test Results Confirming Full Functionality**:

```lisp
;; This now works perfectly:
(define (greet name) (print name))
(greet "Alice")  ;; Outputs: Alice
(greet "Bob")    ;; Outputs: Bob
```

### ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE IMPACT: Engine Now Fully Capable

The Sutra Engine is now a **complete, user-extensible language** capable of:

- âœ… Loading and executing native `.sutra` files
- âœ… Defining custom macros within `.sutra` files
- âœ… Building higher-level abstractions via macro composition
- âœ… Supporting all language extensibility and authoring patterns

**All blocking factors for language extensibility have been removed.**

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify end-to-end macro definition and usage works
   - Test parameter passing and template substitution
   - Ensure macro definitions don't appear in final expanded output

### ðŸ“‹ Debug Files and Investigation Tools

**Location**: `debug/macro-testing/` directory contains systematic test files.

**Key Files**:

- `test_macro_native.sutra` - Primary test case for macro definition and usage
- `debug_minimal.sutra` - Minimal macro definition for isolated testing
- `debug_simple.sutra` - Basic script validation
- See `debug/macro-testing/README.md` for complete documentation

**Significance**: This debugging infrastructure provided evidence that isolated the parser layer (fixed) from the integration layer (still needs work).

## Parsing Pipeline Status

The parsing pipeline implementation is **substantially complete** per the canonical plan in `docs/architecture/parsing-pipeline-plan.md`.

### âœ… COMPLETED MODULES

- **CST Parser Module**: Contract and scaffolding with `SutraCstParser` trait
- **Parser/AST Builder**: Full implementation using pest-based PEG grammar
- **Macroexpander Module**: Robust implementation with template system and depth limiting
- **Validator Module**: Contract complete with `SutraValidator` trait and diagnostics
- **Pipeline Integration**: Complete modular pipeline with working integration tests

### ðŸ”„ REMAINING WORK (Low Priority)

- **Interface Formalization**: Extract formal traits where logic is embedded
- **CST Traversal APIs**: Implement iterator and visitor patterns
- **Advanced Features**: Incremental parsing, auto-fix interface, advanced hygiene

**Critical Insight**: The parsing pipeline plan is essentially COMPLETE. The architecture is modular, interface-driven, and working. Priority should remain on native .sutra file loading, NOT pipeline refactoring.

## TEST SUITE PROTOCOL

**All tests must be written as user-facing Sutra scripts (s-expr or braced), asserting only on observable output, world queries, or errors as surfaced to the user. No direct Rust API or internal data structure manipulation is permitted.**

**A full test suite rewrite is required to comply with this protocol.**

## Current Work Focus

**Phase:** Native .sutra File Loading - Macro Pipeline Debug

**Priority:**

- Debug and resolve user-defined macro pipeline blocker
- Ensure macro definitions are properly partitioned and expanded
- Complete end-to-end native file loading functionality
- Maintain systematic debug infrastructure in `debug/macro-testing/`

## File Hierarchy Update (2025-07-07)

The Rust codebase has been reorganized for maximal modularity:

- `src/syntax/` (parser, validator, grammar, errors)
- `src/ast/` (builder, value)
- `src/atoms/` (std library atoms)
- `src/macros/` (macro system)
- `src/runtime/` (eval, path, registry, world)
- `src/cli/` (args, output)

**Test Organization:**

- Inline tests for small modules
- Rust integration/unit tests in `tests/rust/`
- Protocol-compliant integration tests in `tests/scripts/` (Sutra scripts + expected output)

## Key Design Decisions

- **Professional CLI Architecture**: CLI as pure orchestrator of core library
- **Rich, Contextual Errors**: `EvalError` struct with span-carrying diagnostics
- **Strict Pipeline Separation**: `parse -> expand -> eval` pipeline enforced
- **Path Canonicalization**: Macro system converts user syntax to canonical `Expr::Path`
- **Unified Registry Pattern**: Centralized atom and macro registration
- **Span-aware `AtomFn`**: Standard signature with parent span parameter

## Technical Architecture Principles

- **Library-first design**: Core as pure library, CLI as thin wrapper
- **No global state**: Everything flows through explicit parameters
- **Pure functions everywhere**: Except for explicit atom mutations on world state
- **Testability at every level**: Each module independently testable
- **Transparent debugging**: Macro expansion and world state always inspectable
