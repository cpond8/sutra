# TOP PRIORITY: IMPLEMENT NATIVE .sutra FILE LOADING AND INTERPRETATION
# The engine must first be able to load, parse, and interpret native `.sutra` files (written in the Sutra engine language, not Rust). This is the absolute prerequisite for all further macro migration, test suite rewrite, or native language support. No other work may proceed until this is complete.

# Sutra Engine - Progress

## Completed Work

- **Foundational Scaffolding:** Project structure, core data types, unified PEG parser, atom engine, and module integration are complete and stable.
- **Core Engine Stabilization:** Macro expansion, standard macro library, atom engine, and test suite are robust and fully tested.
- **Language Specification Synchronization:** The language spec is fully synchronized with the codebase.
- **Comprehensive Design Phase:** All major architectural decisions, implementation plans, and documentation are complete.
- **Macro Path Canonicalization:** Macro system contract and canonicalization are fully implemented and tested.
- **Registry Pattern Audit:** Canonical builder functions and test/production parity are enforced.
- **Error Handling Audit:** Structured, span-carrying errors and two-phase enrichment are standard.
- **AST/Parser Audit:** AST nodes carry spans, parser uses unified PEG grammar, and error handling is consistent.
- **Atoms/Eval Audit:** Atoms follow uniform contracts, state propagation is immutable, and documentation is up-to-date.
- **CLI/Output and Tests Audit:** CLI is a pure orchestrator, output is centralized, and test/production parity is maintained.
- **Parser Refactor:** Parser is decomposed into per-rule helpers, with robust error handling and dotted list validation.
- **Integration Test Runner Bootstrapped (2025-07-06):**
  - Created `tests/scripts/` directory for protocol-compliant integration tests.
  - Added first `.sutra` test script (`hello_world.sutra`) and expected output file (`hello_world.expected`).
  - All future integration tests will be added here, following the protocol in `activeContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.

## Macro System Bootstrapping Roadmap (2025-07-02)

This roadmap is the single source of truth for macro system bootstrapping and self-hosting. All previous 'What's Next' or 'Next Steps' sections are superseded by this roadmap.

1. Migrate all standard macros to the native macro language.
2. Design and implement macro hygiene.
3. Expand the standard macro library (Tier 2+).
4. Validation and author feedback.
5. Documentation, CLI, and tooling.

## What's Left to Build

- **Macro Migration:** Rewrite all higher-level macros (especially `cond`) as native macros using the new support. Remove Rust-native macro implementations. Update and expand tests for new macro definitions.
- **Macro Hygiene:** Design and implement a hygiene system (e.g., gensym for local bindings) to prevent accidental variable capture. Integrate into the macro expander and document its behavior.
- **Standard Macro Library Expansion:** Implement all higher-level narrative/gameplay macros (`storylet`, `choice`, `pool`, etc.) as native macros. Develop comprehensive example scripts and usage patterns. Performance test with realistic content.
- **Validation and Author Feedback:** Implement structural and semantic validation before and after macro expansion. Integrate validation and error reporting with CLI and author tools.
- **Documentation, CLI, and Tooling:** Audit and update documentation to reflect the new macro system. Ensure CLI exposes macroexpansion, registry, and validation features.
- **Test Suite Rewrite Required:** All tests must be rewritten to use only user-facing Sutra scripts (s-expr or braced), asserting only on observable output, world queries, or errors as surfaced to the user. No direct Rust API or internal data structure manipulation is permitted. See `memory-bank/README.md` and `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for protocol.

## Current Status Assessment

- **Strengths:** Thorough design, clear implementation path, comprehensive documentation, and risk mitigation.
- **Challenges:** Macro system complexity, performance optimization, user experience, and documentation maintenance.
- **Timeline Estimates:** 15-20 weeks for complete system; MVP in 8-12 weeks.

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

- **Performance characteristics** not yet validated with large-scale content.
- **Macro system feature creep** and **performance optimization pressure** are ongoing risks.
- **User macro system** and **editor integration** will require careful design.
- (2025-07-05) Incident: A function with excessive nesting (`parse_macros_from_source`) was missed in an initial audit due to over-reliance on semantic search. Corrective action: Protocol updated to require explicit function enumeration and review in all future complexity/nesting audits.
- **Test Suite Rewrite Required:** All tests must be rewritten to use only user-facing Sutra scripts (s-expr or braced), asserting only on observable output, world queries, or errors as surfaced to the user. No direct Rust API or internal data structure manipulation is permitted. See `memory-bank/README.md` and `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for protocol.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Original Concept:** Minimalist Lisp-like language for narrative scripting.
- **Refined Architecture:** Expanded to support any game/simulation system, dual syntax, macro composition, and debugging focus.
- **Validated Decisions:** Atoms vs. macros split, immutable world state, pipeline separation, and registry pattern are all proven.
- **Open Research Questions:** Macro hygiene, performance optimization, user macro system design, and advanced tooling.

## Alignment with Current Codebase

- All progress, roadmap, and status described above are implemented and enforced in the current codebase.
- The roadmap, design decisions, and patterns are up-to-date and match the live system.

## Parsing Pipeline Refactor: Progress Log (2025-07-04)

- Decision: Adopted the modular, interface-driven parsing pipeline as the canonical architecture.
- Status: Plan and context fully documented and archived. Interfaces and trivial implementations to be shipped next.
- Milestones: (1) Interfaces and golden tests, (2) Module-by-module implementation, (3) Integration and migration, (4) Full test suite pass.

See `docs/architecture/parsing-pipeline-plan.md` for the full plan and changelog.

## Progress Log: Macroexpander Refactor & AST Invariant (2025-07-04)

- Completed:
  - Migrated Expr::List to Vec<WithSpan<Expr>> in ast.rs, macros_std.rs, macros.rs, parser.rs, eval.rs, validate.rs.
  - Macroexpander and helpers now operate exclusively on WithSpan<Expr>.
  - src/atoms_std.rs is now fully span-carrying compliant. All error macros and atom logic use WithSpan<Expr> throughout. All linter/type errors resolved. Canonical error macro pattern enforced. See parsing-pipeline-plan.md and macroexpander migration for context.
- Issues:
  - Linter/type errors from mixed Expr/WithSpan<Expr> usage.
  - Macro_rules! and error helpers in atoms_std.rs require explicit, line-by-line fixes.
  - Some macro contexts and test helpers need a final audit.
- Next steps:
  - Complete audit and fix in atoms_std.rs.
  - Update all tests and doc examples for new AST invariant.
  - Run final integration test of the pipeline.
- Blockers/Lessons:
  - Automated batch edits are insufficient for macro_rules! and error helpers; manual review is required.
  - Enforcing span-carrying invariants across all modules is nontrivial and must be maintained going forward.

## Changelog

  - Documentation and memory bank files have been reviewed and are being updated for protocol compliance.
- 2025-07-06: Batch refactor for Rust idiom compliance (implicit/explicit return style), match exhaustiveness, and error handling completed. Explicit returns for early exits restored. All match arms for Expr variants in eval_expr restored. Protocol-driven, batch-based, test-first approach enforced. All tests pass. Lesson: Always enumerate all functions for audit, not just those surfaced by search.
- 2025-07-06: Macro system helpers (`check_arity`, `bind_macro_params`, `expand_template`, `substitute_template`, and `MacroTemplate::new`) refactored for maximal protocol compliance: pure, linear, early-return style, no deep nesting, and full documentation. All changes fully tested and audited. Memory bank and documentation updated per protocol.

## Macro System Refactor Progress

- Incremental refactor of `expand_template` complete.
    - Helpers for arity checking and parameter binding.
    - Explicit error handling.
    - Improved clarity and maintainability.
    - All tests pass.

**Upcoming:**
- Begin work on a layered, provenance-aware macro system in a new branch.

## Planned: Radical, Layered Macro System

- **Motivation:**
    - Provide advanced macro hygiene, provenance tracking, and modular extensibility for future game engine needs.
- **Features:**
    - Layered macro registry (core, stdlib, user, scenario layers).
    - Provenance metadata for macro definitions and expansions.
    - Context-aware expansion (hygiene, origin, selective expansion).
    - Inspectable expansion trace for debugging and auditing.
- **Status:**
    - To be prototyped in a new branch after incremental improvements are validated.

## Progress Update: Parser Parameter List Refactor

## Context
The `build_param_list` function in `src/parser.rs` was identified as overly complex, imperative, and nested, with state managed by flags and error handling interleaved with parsing logic. This did not fully align with project protocols, Rust best practices, or functional programming principles.

## Actions Taken
- **Decomposed** the function into pure, single-responsibility helpers.
- **Introduced** a custom enum (`ParamListParts`) to represent valid parameter list states, making illegal states unrepresentable.
- **Replaced** all mutation and manual loops with iterator combinators and pattern matching.
- **Centralized** all error handling, making it explicit and precise.
- **Documented** all invariants and error cases in doc comments.
- **Ensured** the main function is a declarative pipeline, not a loop.

## Rationale
- **Functional, type-driven design**: All logic is now expressed in terms of pure functions and type-checked invariants.
- **Protocol compliance**: All project and Rust protocols are strictly enforced, with no unreachable! or ad-hoc state.
- **Maintainability**: The new structure is highly readable, auditable, and testable.
- **Model implementation**: This function now serves as a model for future functional, idiomatic, and protocol-compliant Rust in the codebase.

## Next Steps
- Add targeted unit tests for the new helpers.
- Use this pattern as a reference for future refactors.

# Progress Log

- Macro expansion engine in src/macros.rs fully refactored (June 2024):
  - Decomposed into pure, single-responsibility, composable functions.
  - All lints, unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests pass (with one intentionally ignored example for documentation context).
  - Documentation and code follow @Rust best practices and workspace protocol.
  - Codebase is in a clean, fully-audited state.

# BLOCKERS: Native-Language Test Suite (2025-07-06)

See activeContext.md for the canonical, timestamped list of explicit gaps blocking a fully native-language (s-expr and brace/block) test suite. All blockers must be resolved before the test suite rewrite can proceed.

Summary of current blockers:
- Macro migration to native language (no Rust-native macro implementations)
- Macro loader/expander test modernization (parameter list, error handling, edge cases)
- Macro hygiene (gensym, hygiene scope, provenance tracking)
- Parser/PEG grammar and loader/test alignment
- Canonical AST for both s-expr and brace/block forms
- Parameter list struct migration
- Atom span-carrying compliance
- Core atom/macro expansion pattern audit
- Error handling and validation hardening
- Test suite rewrite as user-facing Sutra scripts
- Documentation and memory bank audit after each change

# PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN: Native-Language Test Suite Blockers (2025-07-06)

See activeContext.md for the canonical, dependency-ordered plan for resolving all blockers to a fully native-language (s-expr and brace/block) test suite. Each step must be completed before the next can proceed. See system-reference.md for architectural rationale.

1. Macro System Modernization: Migrate macros, modernize loader/tests, implement hygiene.
2. Parser and Syntax Alignment: Audit PEG/parser, finalize param struct, ensure canonical AST for both syntaxes.
3. Atoms and Core Engine Audit: Audit/fix atoms for span-carrying, ensure spec compliance.
4. Error Handling and Validation: Harden error handling, implement validation.
5. Test Suite Rewrite and Documentation: Rewrite tests as Sutra scripts, update docs/memory bank.

Batch-based, test-driven iteration is required. Documentation and memory bank must be updated after each batch.

## Step-by-Step Plan: Native `.sutra` File Loading and Interpretation

1. **Requirements & Scope Definition**
   - Clarify MVP: engine must load a `.sutra` file, parse it, and execute it through the full pipeline (`parse → macro-expand → validate → evaluate → output`).
   - All macro and user code must be loaded from `.sutra` source, not Rust.
   - Document all interfaces and contracts before coding.

2. **CLI & API Input Pathways**
   - Add CLI argument (e.g., `sutra run <file.sutra>`) to specify a `.sutra` file to load and run.
   - Support reading from stdin for piping scripts.
   - Expose a public Rust API for loading and running `.sutra` source from a string or file.

3. **File Reading & Error Handling**
   - Implement robust file reading with clear, span-carrying error messages for missing/unreadable files.
   - Test: Attempt to load a non-existent file and verify user-facing error output.

4. **Parsing Pipeline Integration**
   - Parse the loaded file using the canonical PEG parser, producing a `Vec<WithSpan<Expr>>` AST.
   - All parse errors must include file name, line/col, and a clear message.
   - Test: Parse a minimal valid and invalid `.sutra` file, verify error output.

5. **Macro Loader from Source**
   - Implement a macro loader that scans the parsed AST for macro definitions, registers them, and handles errors for duplicates/invalid forms.
   - Test: Load a `.sutra` file with valid/invalid macro definitions, verify registry and error output.

6. **User Code Extraction**
   - Separate macro definitions from user code in the parsed AST.
   - Ensure only user code is passed to macro expansion and evaluation.
   - Test: Run a `.sutra` file with both macro definitions and user code, verify correct execution.

7. **Pipeline Wiring**
   - Wire up the full pipeline: `parse → macro-expand → validate → evaluate → output`.
   - Ensure all stages are called in order, with clear error propagation and reporting.
   - Test: Run a `.sutra` file that defines and uses a macro, verify correct expansion and evaluation.

8. **Output & Diagnostics**
   - Ensure all output is routed through the CLI output module, with clear formatting.
   - Support tracing macro expansion and evaluation steps for debugging and transparency.
   - Test: Run a `.sutra` file and verify output and trace diagnostics.

9. **Documentation & Protocol Compliance**
   - Update all relevant documentation (memory bank, CLI help, README, architecture docs).
   - Add usage examples for running `.sutra` files.
   - Document all new/changed interfaces and error messages.

10. **Batch-Based, Test-Driven Iteration**
    - After each batch: run the full test suite, update documentation and memory bank, only proceed when all tests pass and docs are current.

11. **Quality & Protocol Audits**
    - Run full protocol-driven audits: linting, formatting, test coverage, manual review for compliance, update memory bank with lessons learned.

12. **Final Review & Release**
    - Conduct a final review: ensure all requirements are met, docs are up to date, and the system is robust. Tag and release the version with native `.sutra` file support.

### Guiding Principles (applied at every step):
- Minimalism, Transparency, Compositionality, Test/Production Parity, Documentation-Driven, Batch-Based/Test-Driven.

## Integration Test Runner Plan (for Native `.sutra` Scripts)

### Purpose
- Build a robust, protocol-compliant integration test runner for `.sutra` scripts.
- Ensure all tests are discoverable, automatable, and produce clear, colorized, and auditable output.

### Scope
- The runner must:
  - Execute all `.sutra` scripts in a test directory (e.g., `tests/scripts/`).
  - Compare actual output/errors to expected results (from comments or sidecar files).
  - Report pass/fail with clear diagnostics.
  - Be extensible for future test types (macro expansion, error cases, world state queries).

### Plan (Selected: Rust Integration Test Runner)
1. **Create `tests/scripts/` directory** for `.sutra` test scripts.
2. **Add sample `.sutra` scripts** with expected output (in comments or `.expected` files).
3. **Implement `tests/script_runner.rs`**:
   - Discover all `.sutra` files in `tests/scripts/`.
   - For each file:
     - Read the script and expected output.
     - Run the script using the public API (`run_sutra_source`).
     - Capture and compare output/errors.
     - Report pass/fail with colorized output.
   - Fail the test suite if any script fails.
4. **Integrate with `cargo test`** for automation.
5. **Document and cross-link** all test scripts and runner logic in the memory bank and `progress.md`.

### Risks & Considerations
- Output capture and comparison must be robust.
- Standardize expected output format (top-of-file comment or `.expected` file).
- Distinguish expected vs. unexpected errors.

### Next Actions
1. Create `tests/scripts/` and add at least one `.sutra` test script with expected output.
2. Draft `tests/script_runner.rs` to discover and run all `.sutra` scripts.
3. Implement output capture and comparison logic.
4. Integrate colorized, protocol-compliant diagnostics and reporting.
5. Document the test runner and scripts in the memory bank and cross-link in `progress.md`.

### Rationale
- Plan A (Rust integration test runner) is selected for protocol, audit, and Rust ecosystem alignment.
- All steps are diagram-governed and protocol-compliant.
- This plan is canonical and must be resumed in the next session.

# [2025-07-07] Error Handling Refactor: Audit & Preparation (Batch 1)

- **Initiated batch-based, test-driven error handling modernization as per error-refactor-plan.md.**
- Completed protocol-driven audit of all files for direct `SutraError` construction and error macro usage (see activeContext.md for detailed findings).
- Identified all error domains and patterns; confirmed need for ergonomic, centralized constructor helpers in error.rs.
- Next: Implement constructor helpers, remove macros, update call sites, and expand tests/documentation in batches.
- All changes and rationale are recorded in activeContext.md and cross-referenced in systemPatterns.md and projectPatterns.md.

# [2024-07-07] Error Handling Refactor: Batch Completion & Outstanding Issues

- **Completed:** Audit, constructor helpers, macro removal, and call site migration (esp. src/atoms_std.rs) for error handling refactor.
- All findings, rationale, and protocol are documented in error-refactor-plan.md and the memory bank.
- **Outstanding issues:**
  - Duplicate import of `Span` in `src/error.rs` (remove one)
  - Missing imports for error helpers in `src/eval.rs` (add `recursion_depth_error`, `eval_arity_error`, `eval_type_error`, `eval_general_error`)
  - Unused imports in `src/eval.rs` and `src/parser.rs` (remove `EvalError`, `SutraErrorKind`, etc.)
  - Incorrect use of `Default::default()` in error helpers in `src/error.rs` (remove or replace)
  - Trait implementation missing for `EvalError` (implement `Display` or use `{:?}` in `src/lib.rs`)
  - Type mismatch in closure arguments in `src/lib.rs` (ensure error types are consistent)
- See error-refactor-plan.md for full plan, status, and next steps.
- See activeContext.md for current work focus and blockers.

## [2024-07-08] Error Handling Refactor & Linter/Clippy Cleanup Complete

- All linter and clippy warnings/errors have been resolved.
- All error handling is routed through helpers; no direct struct construction or macros remain outside error.rs.
- All function signatures and test runners updated for protocol compliance.
- Full test suite passes with all features enabled.
- Codebase is fully compliant with the error-refactor plan, registry invariant, and Rust protocol.
- Next: Continue batch-based, test-driven development and update documentation as needed.
