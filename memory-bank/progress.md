# Sutra Engine - Progress

## What Works (Current State)

### Completed: Foundational Scaffolding (Stages 0-3)
- **Project Structure**: `Cargo.toml` configured and `tests/` directory created.
- **Stage 1: Core Data Types**:
    - `src/ast.rs`: `Expr` and `Span` for the AST.
    - `src/value.rs`: `Value` enum for all runtime data.
    - `src/world.rs`: `World` struct for immutable state.
    - `src/error.rs`: Unified `SutraError` and `SutraErrorKind`.
- **Stage 2: S-Expression Parser**:
    - `src/parser.rs`: Functional recursive-descent parser for S-expressions.
- **Stage 3: Atom Engine (Fully Implemented & Tested)**:
    - `src/eval.rs`: Evaluation loop and "auto-get" symbol resolution implemented.
    - `src/atoms_std.rs`: Complete Tier 1 atom set implemented (`set!`, `del!`, `get`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `eq?`, `gt?`, `lt?`, `not`, `cond`, `list`, `len`).
    - `src/world.rs`: `set` and `del` methods fully implemented with recursive helpers.
    - `tests/core_eval_tests.rs`: A comprehensive integration test suite validates the parser, all atoms, and the full evaluation pipeline. All tests passing.
- **Module Integration**: All modules correctly declared in `src/lib.rs`.

### In Progress: Foundational Scaffolding (Stage 4)
- **`src/macro.rs`**: Foundational structures for the macro system (`MacroFn`, `MacroRegistry`) are defined.
- **`src/macros_std.rs`**: Placeholder module for the standard macro library is in place.
- **Module Integration**: New modules are correctly declared in `src/lib.rs`.

### Completed: Comprehensive Design Phase
- **Architectural Foundation**: Core philosophy, atom/macro specs, pipeline design are all documented and stable.
- **Implementation Planning**: The 10-stage plan and per-file breakdowns are complete.

## What's Left to Build

### Stage 4: Macro System (In Progress)
**Major Components:**

- **(Next)** Pattern-matching macro expansion
- Hygiene system for variable scoping
- Standard macro library (storylet, choice, pool, etc.)
- Expansion tracing for debugging
- Recursion depth limiting

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-3
**Risk:** Medium-High - macro hygiene and expansion can be complex

### Stage 5: Validation System (Not Started)
**Two-Pass Validation:**

- Structural validation (pre-expansion)
- Semantic validation (post-expansion)
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Author-friendly error messages

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-4
**Risk:** Low - validation rules are well-specified

### Stage 6: CLI and Testing Infrastructure (Not Started)
**Command-Line Interface:**

- Script execution with various output formats
- Macro expansion tracing and debugging
- World state inspection and snapshotting
- Integration with all pipeline stages

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-5
**Risk:** Low - thin wrapper over library API

### Stage 7: Standard Macro Library (Not Started)
**Narrative/Gameplay Macros:**

- All Tier 2-3 macros: pools, history, selection, grammar
- Comprehensive example scripts and usage patterns
- Performance testing with realistic content
- Documentation and tutorials

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stages 1-6
**Risk:** Medium - requires balancing power and simplicity

### Stage 8: Brace-Block Translator (Not Started)
**Alternative Syntax Support:**

- Line-oriented parser for brace-block syntax
- Lossless conversion to canonical s-expressions
- Round-trip testing and validation
- Integration with CLI and tooling

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies:** Stage 2 (parser foundation)
**Risk:** Low - well-specified translation rules

## Current Status Assessment

### Strengths
- **Exceptionally thorough design phase** - all major architectural decisions resolved
- **Clear implementation path** - each stage builds cleanly on previous work
- **Comprehensive documentation** - principles, specifications, and examples all complete
- **Risk mitigation** - potential issues identified and addressed in planning

### Potential Challenges
- **Macro system complexity** - hygiene and expansion can be tricky to get right
- **Performance optimization** - may need tuning for large worlds
- **User experience** - need real-world testing with content creators
- **Documentation maintenance** - keeping specs aligned with implementation

### Timeline Estimates
**Total Implementation Time:** 15-20 weeks for complete system

- **MVP (Stages 1-5):** 8-12 weeks
- **Complete Core (Stages 1-7):** 12-16 weeks
- **Full System (Stages 1-8):** 15-20 weeks

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### Current Issues
- Performance characteristics not yet validated with large-scale content.
- Macro system is the next major implementation step and carries significant complexity.

### Future Technical Debt Risks
- **Macro system feature creep** - need to resist adding too many convenience macros
- **Performance optimization pressure** - may conflict with purity/simplicity goals
- **User macro system** - will require careful namespace and security design
- **Editor integration** - may need API extensions for rich editing features

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Original Concept (Early Design)
- Started with minimalist Lisp-like language
- Focus on narrative scripting and interactive fiction

### Refined Architecture (Current)
- Expanded to support any game/simulation system
- Dual syntax for broader accessibility
- Emphasis on macro composition and extensibility
- Strong focus on debugging and author experience

### Validated Decisions
- **Atoms vs. macros split** - proven through exhaustive pattern mapping
- **Immutable world state** - simplifies debugging and testing significantly
- **Pipeline separation** - enables modular testing and tool development
- **Registry pattern** - provides clean extension points

### Open Research Questions
- **Optimal macro hygiene approach** - balance simplicity vs. power
- **Performance optimization strategies** - when and how to optimize
- **User macro system design** - security and namespace management
- **Advanced tooling requirements** - editor support, visual debugging
