# Project Progress

## Current Status: Stabilizing Core Systems

### Completed Major Milestones
- ‚úÖ **Macro System Critical Fixes (July 11)**: Fixed serialization bug where MacroRegistry Fn variants could serialize but not deserialize; extended AST traversal to handle Quote and Spread expressions; identified cloning performance issues for future optimization
- ‚úÖ **Error System Refactoring (July 10)**: Comprehensive 633-line error.rs refactoring completed following project coding standards. Decomposed oversized functions, eliminated DRY violations, implemented data-driven suggestion system, reorganized into 7-section structure, unified type handling, and fixed documentation standards. All tests passing.
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Rich contextual error messages with suggestions, debugging context, and structured data-driven approach
- ‚úÖ **Macro System**: Template macros, core macro infrastructure, parameter binding
- ‚úÖ **Core Parsing**: AST building, validation, CST-to-AST conversion
- ‚úÖ **Atom System**: Comprehensive atom evaluation with enhanced error reporting
- ‚úÖ **Value System**: Complete type system implementation
- ‚úÖ **Runtime Environment**: World state management, evaluation context

### Currently Working On
- Code quality improvements and systematic refactoring
- Performance optimization
- Documentation standardization

### Next Priority
- Complete remaining Tier 1 atoms: `has?`, `core/push!`, `core/pull!`, `rand`
- Fix exists? macro expansion issue
- Complete Tier 1 macros implementation
- Final system integration testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 1 Implementation Status (‚úÖ 75% Complete)
**‚úÖ Completed Atoms**: `abs`, `min`, `max` - all working perfectly with proper error handling and documentation
**‚ö†Ô∏è Partial**: `exists?` - core atom implemented and registered, but macro expansion has path parsing issue
**üî¥ Remaining Atoms**: `has?`, `core/push!`, `core/pull!`, `rand`
**üî¥ Missing Macros**: `at-least?`, `at-most?`, `has?`, `exists?`, `and`, `or`, `empty?`, `push!`, `pull!`, `mul!`, `div!`, `when`, `else`, `let`, `for-each`, `chance?`, `path`, `first`, `last`, `nth`, `debug`, `fail`, `assert`
