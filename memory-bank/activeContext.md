# Sutra Engine - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Memory Bank Initialization and Architecture Finalization
**Priority**: Establishing comprehensive documentation and implementation readiness

### Recent Changes (2025-06-30)
- Completed comprehensive reading of all design documentation
- Synthesized 9 major design documents into cohesive understanding
- Identified complete implementation plan across 3 phases (outline, file plan, per-file plan)
- Established memory bank structure and core documentation

## Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Finish activeContext.md and progress.md files
   - Ensure all core concepts are documented and accessible

2. **Begin Stage 1 Implementation**
   - Create Rust project structure
   - Implement core AST and Value types
   - Set up testing infrastructure

3. **Validate Architecture**
   - Run through design scenarios with planned architecture
   - Confirm atom set is minimal and sufficient
   - Test macro expansion concepts

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Confirmed Design Decisions
- **Dual syntax support**: Both brace-block and s-expression with lossless conversion
- **Pure immutable world state**: Using `im` crate for persistent data structures
- **Strict pipeline separation**: parse → macro-expand → validate → evaluate → output
- **Registry pattern**: For atoms and macros to enable introspection and extension
- **Span-based error reporting**: Throughout entire pipeline for best UX

### Current Design Questions
- **Path representation**: Whether to use `&[&str]` or custom `Path` type for world navigation
- **Macro hygiene**: How sophisticated to make the hygiene system for user-defined macros
- **Performance optimization**: When to implement lazy evaluation or other optimizations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Author Experience Priorities
1. **No explicit `get` operations** - automatic value resolution in all contexts
2. **Clear mutation marking** - all state changes use `!` suffix (`set!`, `add!`, etc.)
3. **Consistent predicate naming** - all boolean checks use `?` suffix (`is?`, `has?`, etc.)
4. **Readable aliases** - comparison operators have both canonical (`gt?`) and readable (`over?`) forms

### Technical Architecture Principles
1. **Library-first design** - core as pure library, CLI as thin wrapper
2. **No global state** - everything flows through explicit parameters
3. **Pure functions everywhere** - except for explicit atom mutations on world state
4. **Testability at every level** - each module independently testable
5. **Transparent debugging** - macro expansion and world state changes always inspectable

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Architectural Insights
- **Minimalism enables power**: Small atom set + macro composition provides unlimited expressiveness
- **Syntax flexibility matters**: Dual syntax removes adoption barriers while preserving power
- **Transparency is crucial**: Authors must be able to understand and debug their content
- **Immutability simplifies**: Pure functional approach eliminates many bug classes

### Implementation Strategy Insights
- **Staged approach is critical**: Each stage validates previous decisions before proceeding
- **Documentation-driven development**: Comprehensive design docs prevent architectural drift
- **Test-driven from start**: TDD approach ensures reliability and debuggability
- **Registry pattern scales**: Enables extension without core modifications

### Narrative Design Insights
- **QBN patterns are achievable**: All Emily Short patterns can be expressed as macros
- **Emergence from composition**: Complex narrative behaviors arise from simple building blocks
- **Author ergonomics matter**: Syntax and debugging tools are as important as functionality
- **Modularity enables reuse**: Storylets, pools, and threads compose cleanly

## Integration with Broader Goals

### Near-term (Next Month)
- Complete Stage 1-3 implementation (AST, parsing, atoms)
- Validate core architecture with realistic examples
- Build robust testing and debugging infrastructure

### Medium-term (Next Quarter)
- Implement full macro system and standard library
- Add brace-block syntax translator
- Create comprehensive example library
- Performance testing and optimization

### Long-term (Next Year)
- User-defined macros and modules
- Advanced tooling (editor support, visual debugging)
- Community and ecosystem development
- Research applications (academic, educational)
