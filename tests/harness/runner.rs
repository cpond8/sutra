//! # Test Execution Pipeline
//!
//! This module implements the full test execution pipeline for Sutra tests:
//! parse → validate → expand → evaluate, with output and diagnostics capture.
//!
//! ## Philosophy Alignment
//! - **Minimalism:** Each stage is a pure function.
//! - **Compositionality:** Pipeline is built from composable stages.
//! - **Transparency:** All errors and diagnostics are surfaced via miette.
//! - **Isolation:** Each test runs in a fresh world, macro, and output environment.

/// Run a single test case through the full pipeline.
