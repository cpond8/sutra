# Self-Critique and Iteration Process

---

## Core Principle: Always Iterate and Critique

Every solution should go through multiple iterations with rigorous self-critique. The goal is to arrive at the simplest, most effective solution. _Never settle for "good enough" -- push until you can go no farther._

## Do Actual Iteration: Don't Just Talk About It

- **Make multiple drafts** - create complete code examples, not mere descriptions of potential code
- **Push each draft further** - each iteration should improve on the previous
- **Keep going until you can go no farther** - don't stop at the first "good" version

## The Iteration Process

## Warning Signs

- Special-case handling for "different" types


### Step 1: Identify the Apparent Complexity

**Look for:**

- Long, deeply nested chain operations
- Elaborate matching logic
- Consecutive nested conditionals
- Unnecessary abstraction layers
- Complex parameter passing between functions
- Helper functions that are only used once
- Functions that just check one condition then delegate
- Multiple functions doing similar things with slight variations

### Step 2: Trace the Actual Data Flow

**Ask Yourself: "What information is really needed?"**

- Examine actual data formats
- Look at real usage patterns
- Understand the core requirements

### Step 3: Ask "Why is this complex?"

**Often the complexity is unnecessary:**

- Are you handling cases that don't exist?
- Is the abstraction actually helping?
- Could this be done more directly?

### Step 4: Unwind the Layers

**Remove abstraction layers to reveal the simple core:**

- Eliminate helper functions that are only used once
- Combine similar operations
- Straighten out the logic flow -- often this reveals deep flaws and redundancy hidden by the former complexity.

### Step 5: Let Context Determine Behavior

- How does this effect the system as a whole?
- Can this be reused?
- Can this be replaced with something more appropriate for the system as a whole?

## Example: Macro Analysis

### Draft 1: Surface-Level Analysis

**Problem**: Complex substitution logic with many functions
**Solution**: Consolidate functions and use parameter structs

**=> Self-critique**: This just hides complexity, doesn't eliminate it.

### Draft 2: Deep Dive

**Problem**: The functions themselves are complex
**Solution**: Simplify the logic inside each function

**=> Self-critique**: Still not addressing the core issue.

### Draft 3: Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: The complexity was unnecessary - context already determined behavior
**Solution**: Remove all special-casing and let context handle it

**Self-critique =>**: Now I'm getting to the real issue!

### Final Draft: Revelation

**The complexity was artificial:**

- The system was already simple, just over-engineered.
- **Had you not kept pushing yourself to the very end, you would never have discovered the true solution.**

## Key Questions for Self-Critique

1. **"Is this really necessary?"**
   - Can I eliminate this complexity?
   - Is this abstraction actually needed?
   - Could I do this more directly?
2. **"Could I do this even more concisely?"**
   - Can I reduce lines without losing clarity?
   - Is there unnecessary repetition?
   - Could I combine related operations?
3. **"Could I make the logic here even clearer?"**
   - Is the control flow obvious?
   - Are the steps self-documenting?
   - Could I make this more like a recipe?
4. **"What is this actually trying to do?"**
   - Am I solving the right problem?
   - Is the real problem actually earlier down the pipeline?
   - Do I even need to solve this?

## Benefits of This Process

- **Readability**: Each step is obvious and isolated
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify individual validation steps
- **Debugging**: Can easily add breakpoints at each validation point
- **Consistency**: Same patterns throughout the codebase
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Linear flow is easier to follow

## Remember

**Simplicity at all levels means**:

- Each function has a single, clear purpose
- No unnecessary abstraction layers
- Let context determine behavior
- Compose simple operations
- If you need a helper function, the original function is too complex

The goal is **composition of simple parts**, not complex abstractions.

## Key Insights

- **Complexity at any level is a sign of poor design**
- **The iterative process reveals the true simplicity**
- **Each iteration should eliminate more complexity, not reorganize it**
- **The final solution is often much simpler than the initial approach**
