;; This suite validates the parsing and evaluation of collections

(test "collections: quoted symbol"
      (expect (value 'foo)
              (tags "collections"))
      'foo)  ; => 'foo

(test "collections: quoted list"
      (expect (value '(1 "two" true))
              (tags "collections"))
      '(1 "two" true))  ; => '(1 "two" true)

(test "collections: nested quoted list"
      (expect (value '(1 (2 (3))))
              (tags "collections"))
      '(1 (2 (3))))  ; => '(1 (2 (3)))
