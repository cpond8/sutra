# Sutra Engine - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Canonical Reference Set**: The canonical reference for the Sutra engine language is Lisp, particularly Scheme. All tests and their expectations should reflect canonical Lisp behavior.

**Architectural Improvement Plan**: Following successful resolution of the variadic macro arity bug (grammar.pest param_items rule fix), implementing systematic improvements to prevent similar issues. Plan developed 2025-07-10 based on root cause analysis.

**Guard Clause Idioms Standard**: All new and refactored code should use let-else/early return for edge/invalid cases, reducing nesting and clarifying main logic.

**Atom/Test Atom Decomposition**: Large or multi-phase atoms and test atoms should be decomposed into focused helpers for clarity and testability.

**CLI/Output Modularization**: CLI/output code should be organized by function group, with helpers extracted for DRY and clarity.

## Next Actions

**SPRINT 1: Quick Wins (1 week) - ✅ COMPLETE**
1. ✅ Development-Time Grammar Checking (1 day) - cargo binary validate_grammar with comprehensive grammar.pest validation, automated shell scripts, and git pre-commit hooks
2. ✅ Enhanced Error Messages with Context (1-2 days) - dramatically improved arity, type, and general evaluation error messages with detailed context, argument summaries, function-specific suggestions, and debugging hints
3. ✅ Comprehensive Unit Testing Strategy (2-3 days) - systematic test coverage including arity_comprehensive.sutra, macro_arity_comprehensive.sutra, grammar_edge_cases.sutra, type/error testing, integration tests, and Rust unit tests for internal functions

**READY FOR SPRINT 2: Complex But High Priority**

**SPRINT 2: High-Value Complex (1-2 weeks)**
4. Grammar Consistency Validation (3-4 days) - Static analysis tool to detect duplicate patterns and rule inconsistencies
5. Debug & Introspection Tools (4-5 days) - New CLI commands for debugging parameter parsing, macro expansion, and pipeline inspection

## Recent Completions

**Variadic Macro Bug Resolution (2025-07-10)**: Fixed critical parsing issue where param_items rule used inline `("..." ~ symbol)?` instead of proper `spread_arg?` reference. Root cause was grammar inconsistency - duplicate patterns without validation. Fix ensures variadic macros like `str+` parse correctly with 0 required parameters and proper rest parameter handling.

**Canonical Macro System**: Variadic macro parsing, expansion, and runtime splicing now match Lisp/Scheme. No implicit splicing; apply is used for runtime argument splicing.

**String Concatenation Atom**: core/str+ now allows zero arguments, returning an empty string.

**Test Design Correction**: wrap macro updated to use (apply list x) for canonical runtime splicing.

**Edge Case Test Update**: The variadic macro edge case test for spreading a non-list was updated to expect an error, per canonical Lisp behavior. The engine correctly signals an error if a non-list is spread.

**Guard Clause/Decomposition Refactor**: Widespread application of let-else/early return idioms, atom/test atom decomposition, and CLI/output modularization completed 2025-07-09.

## System Status

**Current Capabilities**: Macro system is canonical and matches Lisp expectations. All macro and atom features work as intended. All tests now reflect canonical Lisp behavior. Variadic macro parsing is fully functional after grammar fix.

**Test Infrastructure**: Macro operation tests now expect canonical errors for malformed calls, matching Scheme/Lisp reference. All variadic macro tests passing.
