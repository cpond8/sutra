# Sutra Engine â€“ Progress

## Completed Work
- Test suite refactored and protocol-compliant (see activeContext.md)
- Atom standard library modernized
- CLI tooling suite implemented
- Native .sutra file loading and macro system fully functional
- File hierarchy reorganized for modularity
- Debug infrastructure created for macro testing

## Remaining Work
- Final cleanup: remove obsolete files in debug/ and test root
- Expand test coverage for edge cases and complex scenarios
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Macro library expansion and advanced debugging tools

## Known Issues
- Obsolete files pending deletion
- Performance not yet validated for large-scale content
- Macro hygiene and advanced tooling require further design

## Evolution of Decisions
- All major architectural and technical decisions are now centralized in systemPatterns.md and techContext.md

## Reference
- See `activeContext.md` for current work focus
- See `systemPatterns.md` for architecture
