# Sutra Engine - Changelog

## Recent Updates

[2025-01-09 16:45] registry.rs documentation enhancement - Enhanced module documentation with usage workflow example, improved section organization with visual dividers, expanded function documentation with step-by-step process descriptions, comprehensive error documentation, and detailed parameter explanations; exemplifies d1-doc-rules compliance with scannable structure and self-contained sections
[2025-01-09 16:40] registry.rs decomposition - Applied Rules 2&3 to build_canonical_macro_env: decomposed 45→8 lines into focused helpers (build_core_macro_registry, load_and_process_user_macros); eliminated nested match/for loop with guard clauses using ? operator; separated core macro registration from user macro processing; improved error handling flow and single responsibility principle
[2025-01-09 16:35] macros/mod.rs DRY improvements - Applied Rule 2 DRY patterns to eliminate repetitive code: (1) check_recursion_depth & check_macro_recursion_depth utilities for consistent recursion limit checking, (2) extract_list_items utility for Expr::List pattern matching, (3) extract_symbol_from_expr utility for Expr::Symbol extraction; eliminated ~30 lines of repetitive validation patterns while maintaining identical functionality; improved code consistency and maintainability
[2025-01-09 16:30] macros/mod.rs file reorganization - Restructured 702-line file into 7-section module structure: (1) module docs & imports, (2) core data structures, (3) public API (grouped by function: registry, loading/parsing, expansion core, environment), (4) conversions (none), (5) infrastructure (traits & serialization), (6) internal helpers (grouped by function: parsing, arity/binding, expansion, AST traversal, template substitution, trace), (7) module exports; improved navigation with visual dividers and subsection comments; all functionality preserved
[2025-01-09 16:25] Applied guard clause to extract_macro_name - Converted if-let-else pattern to let-else guard clause with early return; improved control flow consistency following Rule 3 patterns
[2025-01-09 16:23] Enhanced check_arity DRY - Consolidated near-identical error returns into single conditional message: "at least" vs "exactly" based on variadic parameters; eliminated duplicate error construction patterns while preserving precise error messaging
[2025-01-09 16:20] Systematic macros/mod.rs refactoring - Applied Rules 2&3 to 4 functions: (1) try_parse_macro_form: decomposed 39→12 lines with validation helpers, (2) expand_macro_once: decomposed 44→15 lines with expansion_error DRY utility, (3) map_ast: decomposed 46→12 lines with map_list/map_if helpers, (4) check_arity: added arity_error DRY utility; eliminated ~150 lines duplication, improved maintainability across entire macro system
[2025-01-09 16:17] Macro bind_macro_params refactoring - Applied Rules 2&3 to variadic parameter handling: let-else guard clause eliminates nesting, with_span DRY utility replaces manual WithSpan construction; improved control flow consistency
[2025-01-09 16:15] Macro substitute_template decomposition - Applied AST function decomposition pattern to 67-line function; extracted substitute_list and substitute_if helpers; added with_span DRY utility; applied let-else guard clause in Expr::Spread case eliminating nested if-let-else; reduced main function from 67→12 lines while preserving all macro expansion functionality; follows established decomposition patterns
[2025-01-09 16:00] std.rs file reorganization - Restructured 1,131-line file into 7-section module structure: imports, data structures, public API (atoms grouped by function), infrastructure (traits), internal helpers (by subsection), and exports; improved navigation and dependency flow; all functionality preserved
[2025-01-09 15:30] Advanced DRY refactoring in std.rs - Implemented ExtractValue trait eliminating repetitive type-checking patterns across extract_* functions; added generic eval_n_args with compile-time arity checking; reduced all extract functions to one-liners; unified argument evaluation patterns; further eliminated ~50 lines of repetitive code while maintaining full functionality
[2025-07-09 23:00] Std.rs helper function refactoring - Extracted common evaluation patterns (eval_single_arg, eval_binary_args, extract_*) eliminating DRY violations; simplified all eval_*_op functions using decomposition patterns; reduced complexity and improved maintainability
[2025-07-09 22:55] Value.rs Display decomposition - Applied AST function decomposition pattern to fmt::Display implementation (~32→10 lines), extracted fmt_list and fmt_map helpers, consistent with established patterns
[2025-07-09 22:50] World.rs guard clause refactoring - Applied let-else patterns and early returns across get, set_recursive, and del_recursive functions, eliminating nested if-let chains and reducing nesting from 4 levels to 2, improved readability and consistency following project guard clause idioms
[2025-07-09 22:45] AST module reorganization - Restructured 356-line mod.rs into 7 logical sections with clear dividers: imports, data structures, public API, conversions, infrastructure, internal helpers, exports; improved navigation and maintainability
[2025-07-09 22:30] AST function decomposition - Refactored build_ast_from_cst (~76→12 lines) and pretty (~45→15 lines) into focused helpers following project patterns; added DRY utilities (with_span, invalid_shape_error); each helper <15 lines with single responsibility
[2025-07-09 20:35] CLI DRY improvements - Extracted 5 helper functions eliminating duplication: file-to-AST pipeline, macro environment setup, safe path display, registry listing pattern, reducing command handler code by ~40%
[2025-07-09 20:25] CLI module organization - Restructured function order into logical groups: Core Utilities → AST Processing → Output/Formatting → Test Infrastructure → Command Handlers (grouped by functional area)
[2025-07-09 20:15] CLI module refactoring - Decomposed monolithic functions, eliminated SRP violations, reduced nesting with guard clauses, extracted color/test helpers for DRY compliance
[2025-07-09 19:55] Fixed variadic macro parameter parsing - Parser correctly identifies ...args syntax and sets ParamList.rest, resolving arity errors
[2025-07-09 15:10] Memory bank compressed - All files reduced to token limits, duplication removed, temporal compression applied
[2025-07-09] Error enhancement plan - 4-phase implementation created
2025-07-08: Test suite refactoring - 16 protocol-compliant scripts, centralized utilities
