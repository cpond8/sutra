# Sutra Engine Memory Bank

## Overview

This memory bank contains the complete synthesis and documentation of the Sutra Engine project, initialized on 2025-06-30 from comprehensive analysis of all design documentation.

## Memory Bank Structure

The memory bank follows the canonical structure with these core files:

### Core Files

1. **[projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md)** - Foundation document defining Sutra's core vision, aspirations, and success criteria
2. **[productContext.md](./productContext.md)** - Why Sutra exists, problems it solves, and user experience goals
3. **[systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md)** - Core architecture, technical patterns, and module boundaries
4. **[techContext.md](./techContext.md)** - Technology stack, development environment, and technical constraints
5. **[activeContext.md](./activeContext.md)** - Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
6. **[progress.md](./progress.md)** - What's implemented, what's left to build, and project status

## Project Current State

**Phase**: Memory Bank Initialization Complete
**Status**: Ready for Stage 1 Implementation
**Next Step**: Begin Rust project setup and core AST/Value type implementation

### Key Accomplishments
- Comprehensive design documentation synthesized
- Complete implementation plan across 8 stages
- All architectural decisions resolved and documented
- Memory bank fully initialized with project context

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Set up Rust project structure following file plan
2. Implement Stage 1: Core data types (AST, Value, World, Error)
3. Establish testing infrastructure and CI/CD

## Architecture Summary

**Core Philosophy**: Minimalism and compositionality inspired by Scheme/Lisp
**Key Pattern**: Atoms (irreducible operations) + Macros (composed functionality)
**Pipeline**: parse → macro-expand → validate → evaluate → output

**Unique Features**:
- Dual syntax support (brace-block ↔ s-expression) with lossless conversion
- Immutable world state with persistent data structures
- Complete macro transparency and debugging
- Registry pattern for extensible atoms and macros

## Documentation Sources

This memory bank was synthesized from analysis of these comprehensive design documents:

1. **01_SUTRA_ENGINE_PHILOSOPHY_AND_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md** - Core philosophy and guiding principles
2. **02_SUTRA_CORE_ARCHITECTURE_AND_ATOM_SET.md** - Engine architecture and atom specifications
3. **03_SUTRA_AUTHORING_PATTERNS_AND_PRAGMATIC_GUIDELINES.md** - Author-facing patterns and macro library
4. **A_LANGUAGE_SPEC.md** - Formal specification of Tier 1 atoms and macros
5. **B_STORYLET_SPEC.md** - Storylet system specification for narrative content
6. **C_THREAD_SPEC.md** - Thread system for modular narrative flows
7. **i_implementation_outline.md** - 10-stage implementation roadmap
8. **ii_implementation_file_plan.md** - Module structure and file organization
9. **iii_implementation_per_file_plan.md** - Detailed per-file API and type specifications

## Memory Bank Usage

This memory bank serves as the complete context for all future development work on Sutra. When resuming work:

1. **Always read ALL memory bank files** to refresh on project context
2. **Update activeContext.md** with current work and decisions
3. **Update progress.md** as implementation stages are completed
4. **Document new insights and changes** in the relevant files

## Implementation Readiness

The project is exceptionally well-prepared for implementation:

- **Architecture**: Fully specified with no major open questions
- **API Design**: Complete type sketches and module boundaries
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test plans for each component
- **Risk Mitigation**: Potential issues identified and addressed
- **Timeline**: Realistic 15-20 week estimate for complete system

## 2025-07-02: Registry/Expander Reliability Audit

A comprehensive audit of macro registry and expander reliability was conducted. Advanced strategies (phantom types, registry hashing, sealing, logging, integration tests, smoke mode, provenance, mutation linting, opt-out API, fuzzing, singleton, metrics) were reviewed and rated. Immediate implementation will focus on integration tests and registry hashing, with others staged for future adoption. See activeContext.md and systemPatterns.md for canonical references and rationale.
