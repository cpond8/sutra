# Sutra Engine - Changelog

## Recent Updates

[2025-07-10 09:58] memory-bank update - Updated progress.md to reflect completed systematic refactoring (eval.rs, macros/mod.rs, registry.rs); added Rules 1,2,3 methodology to projectPatterns.md core heuristics; documented proven 5-phase workflow and synergy patterns; memory bank now captures systematic refactoring approach for future application
[2025-07-10 09:40] runtime/eval.rs guard clause patterns - Applied Rule 3 to call_atom and eval_condition_as_bool (lines 49-105): replaced nested if-let structures with let-else guard clauses and early returns; eliminated 2 levels of indentation in both functions while maintaining identical functionality; improved error handling flow and readability
[2025-07-10 09:36] runtime/eval.rs guard clause patterns - Applied Rule 3 to flatten_spread_args (lines 350-374): replaced nested match/if-let structure with let-else guard clauses and early continue/return patterns; eliminated 3 levels of indentation while maintaining identical functionality; improved readability and followed idiomatic Rust patterns
[2025-07-10 09:35] runtime/eval.rs final DRY elimination - Eliminated duplication in eval_if and eval_quoted_if functions: replaced identical if-else blocks with single branch selection + eval_expr call; reduced both functions by 4 lines each
[2025-07-10 09:34] runtime/eval.rs eval_expr completion - Completed final decomposition of eval_expr: extracted eval_literal_value and eval_invalid_expr helpers; transformed 30-line match statement into clean 3-group dispatch; main function now 15 lines with single responsibility
[2025-07-10 09:30] runtime/eval.rs comprehensive refactoring - Applied Rules 1,2,3 systematically: decomposed 4 functions >20 lines into 12 focused helpers; eliminated repetitive patterns through DRY utilities; applied guard clause patterns; organized into 7-section hierarchy; 321→382 lines with improved readability and maintainability
[2025-07-10 09:19] macros/std.rs DRY improvements - Applied Rule 2 DRY patterns: eliminated 61 lines (477→416) through systematic extraction of repetitive AST construction patterns; created DRY utilities for symbol/number/path creation
[2025-07-10 09:17] macros/std.rs reorganization - Applied 7-section Code Structure Hierarchy to 459-line file: reorganized into clear visual sections with functional grouping and dependency flow ordering

[2025-07-09 16:40] registry.rs decomposition - Applied Rules 2&3 to build_canonical_macro_env: decomposed 45→8 lines into focused helpers; eliminated nested match/for loop with guard clauses using ? operator
[2025-07-09 16:35] macros/mod.rs DRY improvements - Applied Rule 2 DRY patterns: check_recursion_depth utilities, extract_list_items utility, extract_symbol_from_expr utility; eliminated ~30 lines of repetitive validation patterns
[2025-07-09 16:30] macros/mod.rs file reorganization - Restructured 702-line file into 7-section module structure with improved navigation and visual dividers
[2025-07-09 16:25] extract_macro_name guard clause - Converted if-let-else pattern to let-else guard clause with early return
[2025-07-09 16:23] check_arity DRY enhancement - Consolidated near-identical error returns into single conditional message based on variadic parameters
[2025-07-09 16:20] macros/mod.rs systematic refactoring - Applied Rules 2&3 to 4 functions: decomposed into focused helpers, added DRY utilities; eliminated ~150 lines duplication
[2025-07-09 16:17] bind_macro_params refactoring - Applied Rules 2&3 to variadic parameter handling: let-else guard clause, with_span DRY utility
[2025-07-09 16:15] substitute_template decomposition - Applied AST decomposition pattern: extracted substitute_list and substitute_if helpers; reduced 67→12 lines
[2025-07-09 16:00] std.rs file reorganization - Restructured 1,131-line file into 7-section module structure
[2025-07-09 15:30] std.rs advanced DRY refactoring - Implemented ExtractValue trait eliminating repetitive type-checking patterns; added generic eval_n_args with compile-time arity checking
[2025-07-09 23:00] std.rs helper function refactoring - Extracted common evaluation patterns eliminating DRY violations
[2025-07-09 22:55] value.rs Display decomposition - Applied AST decomposition pattern to fmt::Display implementation
[2025-07-09 22:50] world.rs guard clause refactoring - Applied let-else patterns eliminating nested if-let chains; reduced nesting from 4 to 2 levels
[2025-07-09 22:45] AST module reorganization - Restructured 356-line mod.rs into 7 logical sections with clear dividers
