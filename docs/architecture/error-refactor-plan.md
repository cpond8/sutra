# Sutra Error Handling Refactor Plan

> **[2024-07-07] Progress Update:**
> - **A. Preparation:** Complete. All files audited for direct `SutraError` construction and macro usage. Findings documented in the memory bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
> - **B. Implement Constructor Helpers:** Complete. Ergonomic, documented helpers for all error domains implemented in `error.rs`.
> - **C. Remove Macros & Update Call Sites:** Complete for all major files. All error macros removed and all call sites in `src/atoms_std.rs` and related files migrated to use helpers. Imports and argument order corrected. Macro_rules! updated. All direct struct construction replaced.
> - **Current Outstanding Issues (from latest lint/test run):**
>   - Duplicate import of `Span` in `src/error.rs` (remove one)
>   - Missing imports for error helpers in `src/eval.rs` (add `recursion_depth_error`, `eval_arity_error`, `eval_type_error`, `eval_general_error`)
>   - Unused imports in `src/eval.rs` and `src/parser.rs` (remove `EvalError`, `SutraErrorKind`, etc.)
>   - Incorrect use of `Default::default()` in error helpers in `src/error.rs` (remove or replace)
>   - Trait implementation missing for `EvalError` (implement `Display` or use `{:?}` in `src/lib.rs`)
>   - Type mismatch in closure arguments in `src/lib.rs` (ensure error types are consistent)
> - **Work Remaining:**
>   - D. Centralize and Document Error Handling (move all helpers to `error.rs`, expand doc section)
>   - E. Enforce Constructor Usage (add CI lint/test, document enforcement)
>   - F. Update Formatting & Add Tests (Display impl, error formatting tests)
>   - G. Documentation & Onboarding (update onboarding docs, usage examples)
>   - H. Review & Finalization (peer review, proofread, memory bank update)
>   - Fix outstanding issues: duplicate imports, unused imports, Default::default() in helpers, trait impls, closure type mismatches, etc.

> **[2024-07-07] Architectural Update:**
> - **Validator Registry Refactor (Critical):**
>   - Integration test failures revealed that the validator must receive and use the canonical atom registry, not just macro registries.
>   - The validator must check the atom registry for symbols not found in macro registries before reporting errors.
>   - This change is required for test/production parity and to resolve persistent integration test failures (see memory bank and systemPatterns.md).
>   - All call sites and tests must be updated to pass the canonical atom registry to the validator.
>   - See memory-bank/activeContext.md and progress.md for debugging context and rationale.

## 1. Overview & Goals
- **Goal:** Refactor error handling to use ergonomic, domain-specific and general constructor functions, centralize helpers, improve documentation, and enforce usage via lint/test.
- **Benefits:** Improved maintainability, onboarding, type safety, user-facing error quality, and alignment with Rust best practices.

---

## 2. Prerequisites
- Review all current error construction patterns, macros, and formatting logic. **(Done)**
- Ensure all maintainers are aware of the new conventions and rationale (see memory bank updates). **(Done)**

---

## 3. Stepwise Refactor Plan

### A. Preparation
- [x] Review all files for direct `SutraError` construction and macro usage.
- [x] Identify all error domains and common error patterns (e.g., arity/type errors in eval).

### B. Implement Constructor Helpers
- [x] In `error.rs`, implement ergonomic constructor functions for each error domain:
  - General: `parse`, `macro_error`, `validation`, `io`, etc.
  - Domain-specific: `eval_arity_error`, `eval_type_error`, `eval_general_error`, etc.
- [x] Document each helper with clear doc comments and usage examples.
- [x] Clearly distinguish between general-purpose and domain-specific helpers in documentation.

### C. Remove Macros & Update Call Sites
- [x] Remove all error construction macros (e.g., `eval_err!` in `atoms_std.rs`).
- [x] Update all call sites to use the new constructor functions.
- [x] Ensure all error construction is routed through helpers, not direct struct literals.

### D. Centralize and Document Error Handling
- [ ] Move all error construction helpers to `error.rs`.
- [ ] Add a section in `error.rs` (or a dedicated doc) explaining:
  - How to add a new error domain (checklist).
  - When to use general vs. domain-specific helpers.
  - Example usage for each pattern.

### E. Enforce Constructor Usage (Lint/Test)
- [ ] Add a CI test (e.g., using `grep`) that fails if `SutraError {` is found outside `error.rs`.
- [ ] Document this enforcement in the developer guide.
- [ ] (Optional, future) Consider a custom Clippy lint for deeper enforcement.

### F. Update Formatting & Add Tests
- [ ] Ensure the `Display` implementation in `error.rs` uses all available context.
- [ ] Add/expand tests for error formatting, covering all domains and edge cases.
- [ ] Test all error examples in documentation.

### G. Documentation & Onboarding
- [ ] Update or create onboarding documentation:
  - How to add/extend error handling.
  - How to use constructor helpers.
  - How to interpret and format errors.
- [ ] Follow the doc-rules: clear audience, logical structure, concise language, tested examples, and explicit edge cases.

### H. Review & Finalization
- [ ] Peer review all code and documentation changes.
- [ ] Proofread for clarity, accuracy, and consistency.
- [ ] Merge changes and update the memory bank with final status and rationale.

---

## 4. Edge Cases & Constraints
- If a new error domain requires structured context, only introduce a `ContextualError` trait if more than one such domain exists.
- For IO/internal errors, allow optional span; for all author-facing errors, require span at construction.
- If any ambiguity or inconsistency is found, pause and clarify before proceeding.

---

## 5. Maintenance & Follow-up
- Update documentation and tests with every future change to error handling.
- Regularly review enforcement mechanisms (lint/test) for effectiveness.
- Track version history and rationale in the memory bank.

---

## 6. FAQs
- **Q:** What if I need a new error domain?
  - **A:** Follow the checklist in `error.rs` documentation.
- **Q:** Can I construct `SutraError` directly?
  - **A:** No, use the provided constructor helpers; direct construction is CI-banned outside `error.rs`.
- **Q:** When should I use a domain-specific helper?
  - **A:** When the error pattern is common and benefits from a dedicated function (e.g., eval arity/type errors).

# Architectural Addendum: Enforcing Single Source of Truth for Atom Registry

## Summary

A persistent integration test failure in Sutra (`"Unknown macro or atom: core/print"`) has revealed a deeper architectural issue: pipeline stages (validation, evaluation) do not share a single, canonical atom registry. This proposal documents the problem, pinpoints its true cause, and recommends a robust, maintainable fix by enforcing a “single source of truth” registry pattern throughout the codebase.

## Background and Symptoms

* **Symptom:**
  Integration tests fail with:

  ```
  FAIL: hello_world.sutra
    Expected: "Hello, world!"
    Actual:   "Validation Error: Unknown macro or atom: core/print"
  ```
* **Debugging revealed:**

  * Macro expansion, registry setup, and atom registration for `"core/print"` are correct in the main engine pipeline.
  * The error is generated during the **validation** phase, *before* evaluation runs.
  * Adding debug or panic statements after validation are never reached, proving validation is the failing stage.

## True Cause

**Multiple atom registries exist in the pipeline, violating the “single source of truth” principle:**

* The *evaluation* stage receives the correct, fully-populated atom registry (via `build_default_atom_registry()`).
* The *validation* stage, however, uses a different registry—typically an empty or separately-built instance—because the validator does not receive the registry as an explicit parameter.
* As a result, the validator does not recognize `"core/print"` (or any standard atom), causing it to reject valid, macro-expanded code and halt execution early.

This error class can reappear anywhere pipeline components (macroexpander, validator, evaluator, etc.) instantiate their own registry/environment rather than using a shared, canonical one.

## Implications

* **Fragility:** Fixing the immediate call site only patches this bug—similar issues can arise elsewhere, especially as the codebase grows.
* **Inconsistency:** Macro expansion, validation, and evaluation may “see” different language features/atoms, leading to hard-to-diagnose errors and author confusion.
* **Maintainability Risk:** Future features (user-defined atoms, plugins, REPL, etc.) will suffer from similar environment/registry drift if not addressed systematically.

## Recommendation: Enforce a Single Source of Truth for the Atom Registry

### Goals

* Guarantee that *every* pipeline stage (macroexpansion, validation, evaluation, etc.) uses the *same* atom registry, eliminating all state/environment drift.
* Ensure architectural clarity and robustness by making registry use explicit and enforced at the API/type level.
* Prevent similar bugs from arising in the future as the codebase and team grow.

### How to Fix

1. **Refactor All Relevant Functions to Accept the Registry Explicitly**

   * All functions that need to know available atoms (especially `validate`, `eval`, and helpers) must take `&AtomRegistry` (or, optionally, a shared context struct) as a parameter.
   * **Example:**

     ```rust
     // Before:
     pub fn validate(expr: &WithSpan<Expr>, env: &MacroEnv) -> Result<(), SutraError>
     // After:
     pub fn validate(expr: &WithSpan<Expr>, env: &MacroEnv, atom_registry: &AtomRegistry) -> Result<(), SutraError>
     ```

2. **Remove All Internal Registry Construction**

   * Forbid any pipeline component from constructing its own atom registry internally.
   * Registry construction should happen *once* at program/library entry (e.g., in CLI, main library entrypoint, or test harness).
   * All subcomponents receive a reference.

3. **Update All Call Sites**

   * Pass the same registry reference through every stage and from every caller.
   * Update tests, CLI, and integration scripts to match the new signatures.

4. **Optional: Pipeline Context Struct**

   * For extensibility, consider bundling all shared, canonical resources (atom registry, macro environment, etc.) into a `PipelineContext` struct passed through the pipeline.

5. **Document the Pattern**

   * Add code comments and developer documentation making this invariant explicit.
   * State: *“The atom registry is a single source of truth, constructed once and passed by reference to all pipeline stages.”*

6. **Add Tests**

   * Include regression tests ensuring that all stages agree on atom availability (e.g., register a test atom at startup, verify visibility in validation and evaluation).

### Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step)

1. **Identify all validation/evaluation functions that check atom existence.**
2. **Update their signatures to require `&AtomRegistry`.**
3. **Remove any use of `AtomRegistry::new()` or `build_default_atom_registry()` except for the single, canonical construction at startup.**
4. **Update all call sites and pass the registry reference through.**
5. **Test pipeline end-to-end to confirm that macro expansion, validation, and evaluation all agree on atoms.**
6. **Add developer notes and documentation about the architectural invariant.**
7. **(Optional) Consider refactoring to use a shared context struct if passing several shared resources.**

### Benefits

* **Reliability:** Eliminates a whole class of subtle bugs now and in the future.
* **Transparency:** Clear, enforceable API boundaries make the flow of information and capability explicit.
* **Extensibility:** Supports future features (e.g., user-defined atoms, plugin systems) without risk of registry drift.
* **Maintainability:** Makes the codebase easier to reason about, test, and extend.
* **Alignment with Project Principles:** Follows Sutra’s design commitment to minimalism, explicit state, and compositionality.

### Summary

**This issue is a textbook case of the hazards of duplicated or hidden state in a language pipeline. Enforcing a “single source of truth” for the atom registry, via explicit API and dataflow, will permanently resolve this problem and prevent its recurrence—while strengthening the entire codebase for future growth and extension.**

# Sutra “Single Source of Truth” Atom Registry Refactor

## 1. Files and Their Required Changes

### A. `validate.rs` and `validate.rs`-adjacent code

* **What to do:**

  * Change the signature of `validate()` to accept an `&AtomRegistry` parameter.

    ```rust
    // Before:
    pub fn validate(expr: &WithSpan<Expr>, env: &MacroEnv) -> Result<(), SutraError>
    // After:
    pub fn validate(expr: &WithSpan<Expr>, env: &MacroEnv, atom_registry: &AtomRegistry) -> Result<(), SutraError>
    ```
  * In the implementation, when checking if a symbol is a known macro or atom:

    * Use `atom_registry.get(name)` to check atom existence, *in addition* to the macro checks.
    * Example:

      ```rust
      if !env.user_macros.contains_key(name)
         && !env.core_macros.contains_key(name)
         && atom_registry.get(name).is_none()
      {
          // Error: Unknown macro or atom
      }
      ```
  * Remove any internal construction of a registry in validator helpers, if present.

### B. `lib.rs`

* **What to do:**

  * Where `validate` is called (in `run_sutra_source_with_output`), build the registry *once* using `build_default_atom_registry()`, and pass a reference to validation *and* evaluation.

    ```rust
    let atom_registry = build_default_atom_registry();
    validate(&expanded, &env, &atom_registry)?;
    // ... then use &atom_registry for EvalOptions as already done
    ```
  * Ensure `EvalOptions` (or equivalent) still uses the exact same instance.

### C. `registry.rs`

* **What to do:**

  * No change needed if you already only build the registry in this file.
  * Double-check that `build_default_atom_registry()` is never called except at the entry point; *not* from inside validation or evaluation.

### D. `eval.rs` and Evaluation Path

* **What to do:**

  * Confirm that all evaluation uses the atom registry provided via `EvalOptions` (as it appears to do).
  * **No code should ever call `AtomRegistry::new()` or `build_default_atom_registry()` except at the very top level.**
  * If you have any helpers or sub-functions that previously built their own registry, update them to take a reference.

### E. `atoms_std.rs`, `atom.rs`

* **What to do:**

  * No change needed; these should just define how atoms are registered.
  * Ensure there is a *single point* (typically in `build_default_atom_registry()`) where atoms are registered.

### F. `tests/`, `integration/`, and Script Runners

* **What to do:**

  * Update test harnesses, integration tests, and script runners to accommodate the new `validate` signature, passing a shared registry as needed.
  * **For integration tests that use library functions:**

    * Build the atom registry once at test setup.
    * Pass the same registry to all validation/evaluation calls.
  * **For tests that shell out to a binary:**

    * Ensure the binary uses this canonical pattern internally.

### G. Any other file that:

* Calls `validate`
* Instantiates an `AtomRegistry`
* Checks for atom existence

## 2. Concrete Steps

### Step 1: Change the `validate` function and all its direct callers

* In `validate.rs` and every file that calls `validate`.
* Update signature and implementation as above.

### Step 2: Remove redundant registry instantiations

* Search for all `AtomRegistry::new()` and `build_default_atom_registry()` calls.
* Remove any that are not at the top level (entrypoint, test setup, etc.).

### Step 3: Update Tests and Runners

* Fix test and runner code to use the updated API, passing the registry through.

### Step 4: Audit All Use of Atoms

* Search for any function or helper that checks for atom presence and ensure it uses the provided registry, not its own.

### Step 5: Documentation and Invariant

* Add a code comment to `atom.rs` and `validate.rs`:
  *“The atom registry is a single source of truth and must be passed by reference to all validation and evaluation code. Never construct a local/hidden registry.”*

## 4. Example: Core Implementation Diff

**`validate.rs`:**

```diff
-pub fn validate(expr: &WithSpan<Expr>, env: &MacroEnv) -> Result<(), SutraError>
+pub fn validate(expr: &WithSpan<Expr>, env: &MacroEnv, atom_registry: &AtomRegistry) -> Result<(), SutraError>
 ...
-    if !env.user_macros.contains_key(name) && !env.core_macros.contains_key(name) {
+    if !env.user_macros.contains_key(name)
+       && !env.core_macros.contains_key(name)
+       && atom_registry.get(name).is_none()
     {
         return Err(SutraError { ... });
     }
```

**`lib.rs`:**

```diff
-validate(&expanded, &env)?;
+let atom_registry = build_default_atom_registry();
+validate(&expanded, &env, &atom_registry)?;
 ...
-let opts = EvalOptions {
-    max_depth: 1000,
-    atom_registry: build_default_atom_registry(),
-};
+let opts = EvalOptions {
+    max_depth: 1000,
+    atom_registry: atom_registry,
+};
```

**In `tests/`, update:**

```diff
-validate(ast, env)?;
+validate(ast, env, &atom_registry)?;
```

## 5. Summary

* **Files Touched:** `validate.rs`, `lib.rs`, all callers/tests, possibly `script_runner.rs`, `registry.rs` (for audit).
* **Change Scope:** Moderate; mostly function signature and call site updates, plus minor implementation logic.
* **Outcome:** Registry drift is impossible; all macro/atom existence checks share the canonical, correct state.
