# Sutra Engine - Changelog

## Recent Updates

[2025-07-11 09:51] Comment cleanup: Removed repetitive "Guard clause:", "Happy path:" tags from 12 functions - eliminated visual clutter while preserving useful descriptive content, code structure is now self-evident
[2025-07-11 09:41] Documentation compliance complete: Applied 15-token limit to private helpers (reduced 5 over-documented functions), added comprehensive documentation for parse_macros_from_source public API, standardized "- DRY utility" pattern across all simple helpers - ensures scope-appropriate documentation per project standards
[2025-07-11 09:34] Error hygiene improvement complete: Enhanced SutraMacroError::Expansion to preserve structured error information instead of flattening to string - added source_error_kind, suggestion, and source_span fields to maintain access to EvalError suggestions, expanded code, and precise error locations for better debugging
[2025-07-11 09:22] Macro module reorganization complete: Restructured 1034-line src/macros/mod.rs with enhanced subsection organization - 8 focused subsections in Section 5 (Macro Definition Parsing, Arity and Binding Helpers, Validation Helpers, Error Handling Helpers, Macro Expansion Logic, AST Traversal Helpers, Template Substitution Helpers, Tracing and Debugging Helpers) - improved navigation and maintainability
[2025-07-11 09:14] Error hygiene & registry ergonomics complete: (1) Fixed hardcoded '<unknown>' context loss by extracting macro names before recursion checks; (2) Enhanced error preservation from SutraError->SutraMacroError; (3) Added registry overwrite detection, unregister API, AsRef<Path> support
[2025-07-11 09:03] Critical macro system issues fixed: (1) MacroRegistry serialization bug - Fn variants could serialize but not deserialize, now only Template variants are serialized; (2) Incomplete AST traversal - map_ast now handles Quote and Spread expressions; cloning overhead deferred as major architectural change
[2025-07-10 21:24] Phase 2 atoms COMPLETE + Critical validation bug discovered: has?, core/push!, core/pull!, rand fully implemented and working. System-level investigation revealed validation system design flaw: treats ALL symbols as macro/atom names, doesn't understand context between function names vs variable references.
[2025-07-10 20:48] Phase 1 COMPLETE: Fixed exists? macro infinite recursion by renaming atom to core/exists? - all 4 atoms (abs, min, max, exists?) working perfectly
[2025-07-10 20:38] changelog.md compression per r2-memory-bank rules - reduced from 70+ lines to <30 by summarizing oldest 50%, keeping recent detailed entries
[2025-07-10 20:36] activeContext.md updated with complete remaining implementation list - added specific atoms (`has?`, `core/push!`, `core/pull!`, `rand`) and all 23 missing macros for comprehensive tracking
[2025-07-10 20:32] Memory bank compression per r2-memory-bank rules - activeContext.md reduced from 800+ to <200 tokens, proper bullet format, focus constraints enforced (≤3 current, ≤5 next, ≤4 done)
[2025-07-10 20:31] Phase 1 core atoms implementation completed - abs, min, max atoms working perfectly; exists? core atom implemented but macro expansion issue identified
[2025-07-10 12:55] Canonical language implementation gap analysis completed - identified missing Tier 1 atoms and macros for s-expression engine completion
[2025-07-10 12:26] Proactive documentation standards integration - Enhanced Memory 2800289 to include documentation-while-writing principles alongside guard clause patterns
[2025-07-10 12:22] validate_grammar.rs documentation cleanup - Applied memory-guided documentation standards, reduced documentation by ~200 lines while maintaining clarity
[2025-07-10 11:37] validate_grammar.rs systematic refactoring complete - Applied 5-phase methodology, decomposed 68-line function into focused helpers, eliminated 9 DRY violations
[2025-07-10 10:51] Sprint 1 COMPLETE: Comprehensive Unit Testing Strategy - created systematic test coverage including arity_comprehensive.sutra, macro_arity_comprehensive.sutra, grammar_edge_cases.sutra
[2025-07-10 10:43] Sprint 1 Task 2 Complete: Enhanced Error Messages with Context - dramatically improved arity, type, and general evaluation error messages with detailed context
[2025-07-10 10:23] Sprint 1 Task 1 Complete: Development-Time Grammar Checking - implemented cargo binary validate_grammar with comprehensive grammar.pest validation
[2025-07-10 10:17] Fixed critical variadic macro arity checking bug - changed grammar.pest param_items rule from inline pattern to proper spread_arg reference
[2025-07-10 09:58] memory-bank update - Updated progress.md to reflect completed systematic refactoring, added Rules 1,2,3 methodology to projectPatterns.md
[2025-07-10] Systematic refactoring: runtime/eval.rs, macros/std.rs, error.rs comprehensive refactoring with guard clauses, decomposition, DRY patterns
