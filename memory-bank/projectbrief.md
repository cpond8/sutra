# Sutra Engine â€“ Project Brief

## Project Vision

Sutra is a universal substrate for compositional, emergent, and narrative-rich game systems. The core vision is an engine that enables designers to build interactive fiction and deep simulations from a minimal, compositional core.

## Core Aspirations

- Model any gameplay or narrative system via composition of simple parts (atoms and macros)
- Enable robust, transparent, and extensible authoring
- Ensure the core is simple yet powerful
- Emphasize minimalism and compositionality

## Key Design Philosophy

- Minimal core forms, inspired by Scheme/Lisp
- All higher-level constructs built as macros over atoms

## Target Use Cases

- Interactive fiction, narrative games, QBN systems, storylets, agent-based simulations, emergent gameplay, educational/experimental games

## Success Criteria

- Expressiveness, compositionality, transparency, extensibility, performance, portability
