## Recent Updates

[2025-07-10 12:26] Proactive documentation standards integration - Enhanced Memory 2800289 to include documentation-while-writing principles alongside guard clause patterns; prevents over-documentation during initial coding rather than requiring cleanup; applies public/private API criteria, 15-token limit, and "let code speak" principle during development; creates unified habit for both code structure and documentation scope
